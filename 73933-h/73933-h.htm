  <h2 class='c007'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The following account of the founding of New England is
intended to serve as an introduction to the later history of
that section, and to the study of its relations with other portions
of the Empire and with the mother-country, as well as
of the section's influence upon the nation formed from such
of the colonies as subsequently revolted. The book thus
necessarily deals mainly with origins, discussing the discovery
and first settlement of the region; the genesis of the religious
and political ideas which there took root and flourished;
the geographic and other factors which shaped its economic
development; the beginnings of that English overseas empire,
of which it formed a part; and the early formulation of
thought—on both sides of the Atlantic—regarding imperial
problems.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is no lack of detailed narratives, both of the entire
period covered by the present volume and, on an even larger
scale, of certain of its more important or dramatic episodes.
New material brought to light within the past decade or two,
however, has necessitated a revaluation of many former
judgments, as well as changes in selection and emphasis.
Moreover, our general accounts do not, for the most part,
adequately treat of those economic and imperial relations
which are of fundamental importance; for the one outstanding
fact concerning any American colony in the colonial period
is that it was a dependency, and formed merely a part of a
larger and more comprehensive imperial and economic organization.
Consequently, the evolution of such a colony can be
viewed correctly only when it is seen against the background
of the economic and imperial conditions and theories of the
time.</p>

<p class='c001'>While the author, accordingly, has endeavored to place the
local story in its proper imperial setting, he has endeavored also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>to distinguish between its various elements, and to display the
conflicting forces at work in the colonies themselves. The
old conception of New England history, according to which
that section was considered to have been settled by persecuted
religious refugees, devoted to liberty of conscience, who, in
the disputes with the mother-country, formed a united mass of
liberty-loving patriots unanimously opposed to an unmitigated
tyranny, has, happily, for many years, been passing. In his
own narrative of the facts, based upon a fresh study of the
sources, the author has tried to indicate that economic as well
as religious factors played a very considerable part in the
great migration during the early settlement period, in the
course of which over sixty-five thousand Englishmen left
their homes for various parts of the New World, of which
number approximately only four thousand were to join the
New England churches. He has also endeavored to exhibit
the workings of the theocracy, and to show how, in the
period treated, the domestic struggle against the tyranny
exercised by the more bigoted members of the theocratic party
was of greater importance in the history of liberty than the
more dramatic contest with the mother-country.</p>

<p class='c001'>While the local narrative is based wholly upon original
records, much use has been made also of the rapidly increasing
number of scholarly monographs upon particular topics, the
indebtedness to which will be found more particularly set
forth in the footnotes. It is true that many points—such
as land-tenure, in spite of all that has been written upon it—yet
remain to be cleared up before we can be quite sure that
we understand a number of matters connected with colonial
institutions. Nevertheless, so much work of this character
has already been done, which has only in part found its way
into popular accounts, that it seems as if the time had come
for a serious attempt to recast the story of early New England,
and to combine these results of recent research with the more
modern spirit, in a new presentation of the period.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>To those who first encouraged him to undertake the work,—interrupted
by the war,—and who, in one way and another,
have assisted him in his enterprise, the author takes this opportunity
to offer his most sincere and grateful thanks.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER I <br> <br> THE AMERICAN BACKGROUND</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In the name of the country which to-day occupies the
major part of the inhabitable portion of North America is indicated
the twofold nature of its history; for the story of the
United States may evidently be approached, either from the
standpoint of a federal nation, or from that of its component
political units. These units, although in themselves separate
states, are geographically divided from one another, for
the most part, by boundaries which are purely artificial. Natural
frontiers consist of the sea, deserts, mountains, rivers, and
the now almost obsolete ones of forests and swamps. A glance
at the map shows that such natural barriers are only a negligible
part of the boundaries between our various states and territories.
Rivers alone form an exception, and these, for several
reasons, are the least satisfactory for the purpose.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c014'><sup>[1]</sup></a> Were
the federal tie dissolved, and these now united commonwealths
to become completely independent, and possibly hostile, the artificial
character of their limits would at once become obvious.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this it has followed, as settlement has gradually spread
over the continent, bringing innumerable communities into existence,
that these have tended to group themselves into sections,
united by common modes of thought, ways of life, and
economic needs. Histories of the individual states are almost
as arbitrarily localized as the histories of the counties within
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>them; but the story of any of the sections into which the country
has divided from time to time possesses an organic unity
created by the forces of life itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some of these divisions have tended to remain permanent,
while others have passed with the development of the country.
During the colonial period, when the English inhabited only
the comparatively narrow strip of land between the sea and the
mountain-barrier of the Appalachian system, the colonists fell
into three natural groups,—the New England, the Middle, and
the Southern,—determined by climatic, economic, and cultural
conditions. These factors, operating with others somewhat
more fortuitous, made the distinctions both lasting and
marked, the extreme northern and southern groups exhibiting
their differences more clearly than the intermediate one lying
between them.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the frontier was extended west of the mountain-barrier,—and,
indeed, on a smaller scale, even earlier,—another
grouping came into existence, that of East and West, or old
settlement and frontier. This division was also to persist,
with an ever-enlarging East and an ever-retreating West. If
the economic and political ideas of these new sections were to
remain somewhat sharply contrasted, the distinctions between
the original extreme eastern groups were also continued, like
lengthening shadows across the mountain ridges, and the
whole country was to find itself aligned in two hostile groupings
in the most tragic division that it has yet had to face—that
between the North and the South.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the New England group we have one which, in spite of
minor differences, is unusually homogeneous. Not only are
the boundaries between the six states which now form it negligible,
but the section, as a whole, is a geographical unit, within
which a common life, based upon generally similar economic,
political, and religious foundations, has constituted a distinct
cultural strain in the life of the nation. The “New England
idea” and the “New England type” have been as sharply defined
as they have been persistent; and, if, in our own day,
they seem, to some extent, to be passing, their influence may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>be no less living because spread broadcast throughout the
whole land, and absorbed into the common national life.</p>

<p class='c001'>Effective natural boundaries, defining a limited area, are of
determining influence in fostering the life of primitive peoples
or of civilized colonies. Diffusion over an unlimited space, in
the one case, tends to weaken the hold on the land and the
growth of the state, while, in the other, it greatly retards the
development of those elements that make for civilized life.
Aside from other factors, the possession by the English, in the
settlement period, of a limited and protected area, naturally
restricted by the sea and the mountains, resulted, speaking
broadly, in the building up of thickly settled, compact colonies
as contrasted with the boundless empire of the French, opened
to them by their control of the Mississippi and the St. Lawrence
rivers. It is noteworthy that, of the great river-highways
leading to the interior of the continent,—the St. Lawrence,
the Hudson-Mohawk, and the Mississippi,—none was
at first possessed by the English, who had everywhere, unwittingly
but fortunately, selected portions of the coast where
their natural tendency to expand was temporarily held in
check.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Appalachian barrier, which thus served to protect and
to concentrate the efforts of the English, may be said to extend
from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to Alabama, coming nearest to
the coast in passing across New York. In the northern part
of Maine, where the mountains descend to a low water-shed,
enormous forests, with no easy river-route facilitating peaceful
or warlike travel, formed almost as effective a barrier; while
passage southward, along the coast, was impeded during the
early period by the presence of a foreign nation, the Dutch.
There were, indeed, certain narrow entrances to this enclosed
territory from the north, as the larger streams, flowing southward
from the water-shed along the Canadian boundary, could
be utilized, in connection with those flowing northward from
its other slope to the St. Lawrence. The many falls along
their courses, entailing laborious carries in the dense forest,
together with the necessary longer ones across the height of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>land, made these routes more suitable, however, for the military
needs of savages than for the movement of troops in large
bodies, or for the purposes of trade.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c014'><sup>[2]</sup></a> The main passage for
travel and transport from Canada to the south lay wholly to
the west of New England, by way of the Richelieu River and
Lake Champlain, which latter well deserved its Indian name
of “key to the country.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Within the boundaries thus roughly defined and the sea, lies
a land said to contain a greater diversity of natural features
than any other of equal area in the United States. To the
west and north are the Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts, the
Green Mountains of Vermont, the White Mountains of New
Hampshire, and the scattered peaks of Maine. From a height
of fifteen hundred to two thousand feet at the base of the
mountains, a gently sloping upland descends gradually to Long
Island Sound and the Atlantic. Although, at first glance, its
surface seems to present only a confused mass of low-lying
hills, their tops are seen to show a marked uniformity of level
as they gradually slope downward toward the south and east;
and geological evidence makes it almost certain that, at one
time, this region was a plain, resulting from the wearing down,
by denudation, of an earlier mountain range. Subsequent
alterations in its surface, due to erosion and other factors, gave
rise to the present uplands and lowlands, which have been of
determining influence in the peopling of the section, the rugged
uplands offering so hard a subsistence that they were nowhere
willingly chosen for settlement so long as land might still be
had in the lowlands.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although, largely in the eighteenth century, economic pressure
in the happier valleys forced many farmers to move to
the hills, the opening of the West drew many of them to the
prairies during the following century, and the population, like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>water which had been forced above its level, slowly drained
off the uplands again, through the sluiceway of the Mohawk
Valley. To-day, dying hill-towns, abandoned farms, and the
yet unpeopled wilderness of northern Maine, tell the story of
this struggle against geographical conditions.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c014'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This formation of upland and valley extends to the shore-line
of Sound and ocean, the broad coastal plain, which is so marked
a feature from New Jersey southward, being almost wholly
absent in New England. This is probably due to a subsidence
of the shore, which allowed the ocean to flow back over part
of the land, and which also explains the many hundred islands
off the coast of Maine, and the drowned river valleys along the
Sound. So numerous are the islands, bays, and headlands of
the rugged coast north of the Isles of Shoals, that they expand
the two hundred and thirty miles of shore to nearly three
thousand, if all are included in the measurement. In this section,
also, there are many good harbors, particularly that of
Portland, but the coast is so greatly dissected as to make land
communication along it very difficult; while the small boats,
which partially served the needs of commerce and travel in
early days, were seriously interfered with by the great rise and
fall of the tides. Both these conditions tended to isolate the
colonial settlements and hinder their development. The upland
country, with its poorer soil and more difficult conditions
of life, also approaches nearer to the sea in Maine and New
Hampshire than farther south, so that, although Portsmouth,
too, has a fine harbor, those states have always been more thinly
settled than the others.</p>

<p class='c001'>The coast of Massachusetts is less rugged, but more varied.
South of the granite headland of Cape Ann, the shores of
Boston Bay are still rocky and irregular; but both shores of
the great sandy curve of the Cape Cod peninsula, which, with
Cape Ann, encloses the waters of Massachusetts Bay, are
smooth and moulded by wind and wave. The coast again
becomes rough around Buzzard's Bay, while the almost land-locked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>waters of Rhode Island have drowned the old river-system
of that state. Opposite Connecticut lies Long Island,
the only island of any considerable size along the entire Atlantic
coast; so that the Sound, or inland sea, thus formed between
it and the mainland, gives to Connecticut the advantage of a
quiet, protected waterway for all its ports.</p>

<p class='c001'>The value of a coast-line, however, depends not alone upon
its own features, but upon its relations with the interior, both
as to means of communication, and as to the soil and products
of the back-country. During the colonial period, the lines of
communication were naturally along waterways. With the
small tonnage of the vessels then employed, even the sea-going
ones, by utilizing rivers, could pass far inland; and we find
Henry Hudson penetrating to Albany in the same ship in which
he had crossed the ocean. The almost interminable length of the
St. Lawrence and the Mississippi lured the French ever deeper
into the wilderness in quest of the retreating fur-trade, so that
their empire became hardly more than a series of far-flung forts
and trading-posts. The rivers of New England, on the other
hand, having their rise in the Appalachian barrier, and interrupted
by many falls in their short courses, led to no vast
domain beyond, and offered little temptation to the settler to
leave their fertile valleys and tide-swept mouths. This lack
of inland navigation not only tended to concentrate settlement
near the coast, or on the lower navigable reaches of such streams
as the Connecticut, but, also, in a later period, hastened the
progress of turnpikes and railroads more quickly in New England
than anywhere else in the country.<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c014'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>At first, however, rivers were the only means of communication
with the interior, and settlements along the coast of
Massachusetts, and on Buzzard's and Narragansett bays,
tended to remain maritime in character, extending inland but
slowly; whereas those located on such streams as the Kennebec
and the Connecticut absorbed the rich fur-trade for which they
formed the main routes. This trade, it may be noted, was
exhausted earlier in New England than elsewhere, on account
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>of the comparatively limited drainage basins of the river-system,
so that the people were sooner forced to depend upon
agriculture, fishing, commerce, and manufactures.</p>

<p class='c001'>Land travel continued both difficult and costly in all the
colonies throughout the whole of the earlier industrial period,
and roads were so poor, even a century after New England was
settled, that not until 1722 was a team driven for the first time
from Connecticut to Rhode Island. To emphasize the effect
of rivers, we may note that in New York, where the Hudson
was the highway, the average cost of carrying a bushel of wheat
one hundred miles was but two pence, compared with a shilling
in Pennsylvania, where forty wagons, one hundred and
sixty horses, and eighty men were required to transport the
same amount of freight handled by two or three men on a
scow in New York. This high cost of land carriage, which,
added to the ocean freights, had the effect of fostering home
manufactures as against importations from England, also restricted
the areas of distribution, and tended to localize industry.<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c014'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It was not, however, merely the lack of an adequate system
of river transport that served to stimulate manufacturing in
New England in competition with the mother-country. The
character of such rivers as she possessed peculiarly adapted
them for the purpose of supplying power, for not only are falls
and rapids numerous in all of them, but the “fall-line” in New
England is nearer tidewater than it is anywhere else along
the coast. In addition, the regularity of the rainfall, and the
great number of lakes, which form natural reservoirs, cause the
flow of the rivers to be more constant than in other parts of
the country. From all these causes, the little Merrimac, for
example, which is otherwise insignificant as an American river,
is the most noted water-power stream in the world.<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c014'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The soil of New England is of glacial origin, about three
quarters of it being of boulder-clay, stubborn in character and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>difficult to cultivate, but of fair and lasting fertility, due to
the steady decomposition of the smaller pebbles. The remainder,
largely in the southeast, is sandy and of little or no
use for agriculture, owing to the rapid draining away of all
moisture.<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c014'><sup>[7]</sup></a> That on the uplands is thinner and poorer than in
the valleys, and the uplands predominate.</p>

<p class='c001'>A hard living may be forced from such a soil; but the lazy
or unskilled fail to subsist, much less leave a surplus. Tests
of white and colored farmers in the north indicate that, if the
efficiency of the former be taken as 100, that of the latter is but
49,<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c014'><sup>[8]</sup></a> from which fact the economic impossibility of slavery would
seem to be established for New England, as that institution requires
the production of a considerable surplus over individual
needs, even by inefficient labor. In Barbadoes, on the other
hand, a hundred acres planted in sugar were tended by fifty
slaves and seven white servants; a similar amount of land, if
cotton were raised, required forty-five blacks and five whites;
while the cultivation of ginger necessitated the labor of seven
and a half persons per acre.<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c014'><sup>[9]</sup></a> The economic, social, and political
results of such utilization of the soil, as compared with the
subsistence farming of New England, are too obvious to need
elaboration. As we shall see, the Puritans were not wholly
averse to owning slaves, and were often wont, in ethical cases,
to weigh both religious scruples and economic considerations.
In this case, the latter prevailed, without detriment to the
former, and the abolition sentiment of the nineteenth century
was rooted in the glacial soil of the seventeenth.</p>

<p class='c001'>The soil was one which did not foster large plantations, as
in the South, but small farms tilled by their owners, with little
help from slave or indented servant. There was, therefore,
no economic factor at work in New England tending to wide
dispersal, as against the obvious need of compact settlement
for purposes of protection, mutual help, and social intercourse.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>The early New Englander was a somewhat hesitating believer
in the injustice of slavery. He was a strong believer in a town
grouped about a church. The soil confirmed and strengthened
him in both convictions.</p>

<p class='c001'>This compact form of settlement, in turn, however, caused
the village lands of New England to become exceedingly high-priced
as compared with the plantation lands of the southern
colonies. In the seventeenth century, New England farms
very rarely contained over five hundred acres, in contrast to
the average Virginian plantation of five thousand; but New
England land was worth about fourteen times as much per acre
as that in Virginia, and a hundred-acre homestead in the north
was equal in value to a fair-sized plantation in the south.<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c014'><sup>[10]</sup></a> All
these factors, operating with others, emphasized the characteristic
nature of New England expansion, which was almost invariably
a migration, not of individuals, but of churches and
towns, or, at least, of small neighborhood groups.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the land was first settled, it was everywhere covered
by a dense forest, except for meadows here and there, along the
shore or in the larger river-bottoms. Even to-day, of the
thirty thousand square miles of land-surface in Maine, the
forest is said to extend over twenty-one thousand, a district
as large as New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Connecticut
combined.<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c014'><sup>[11]</sup></a> These forests, mainly of hard-wood, deciduous
trees, with an admixture of conifers in Maine, had been practically
untouched by the natives, except by burning the underbrush.
In fact, Whitney claims that more trees had been
destroyed by the beavers than by the Indians.<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c014'><sup>[12]</sup></a> Although
building stone is plentiful in New England, this abundance of
timber along the Atlantic coast determined the form of the
colonial architecture, and developed a type of wooden building
little used in England. It also provided the materials for ship-building,
the forests growing to the very edge of a shore indented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>almost everywhere by suitable harbors; and, in the
early period, this industry is found scattered along the entire
shore. But it tended to concentrate at fewer points, as the
lumber-supply near at hand became exhausted, and the tonnage
of vessels increased. “In reading the early commercial
history of New England,” however, as Miss Semple well says,
“one seems never to get away from the sound of the ship-builder's
hammer, and the rush of the launching vessel.”<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c014'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The climate, though varying in intensity from northern
Maine and New Hampshire to southern Connecticut, and also
from inland to the sea, is, on the whole, a severe one. Snow
falls to a considerable depth everywhere, remaining in the
mountains till late in the spring, the lower mean temperature
of the year, as compared with the coast farther south, being
due to the greater cold of winter rather than to a cooler summer.
The seasonal changes, indeed, are very marked, and the cultural
influence of “the harshness of contrasts and extremes of
sensibility,” of a “winter which was always the effort to live,”
and a summer which was “tropical license,” must formerly
have been even greater than to-day.<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c014'><sup>[14]</sup></a> A noteworthy feature of
our Atlantic coast, climatically, is the crowding together of the
isothermal lines, so that the frigid and tropical zones are
brought within twenty degrees of latitude, as compared with
forty in Europe. This bringing the products of so many climatic
regions comparatively near to one another greatly stimulated
intercolonial trade, which New England early claimed
the largest share in carrying.<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c014'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>We thus see how the mountain-barrier kept the New Englander
within bounds; how the lack of long navigable rivers
prevented him from advancing far inland, even within his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>narrow limits; how the bleak and stony uplands held him
along the coast and lower river valleys; how the soil discouraged
him from agriculture; and, on the other hand, how his
numerous harbors, the quantity of timber for ship-building,
and his central position for the carrying trade, all drew him
out to sea.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was another, and most important factor, however,
luring him to quit the land, for the banks and shoals, extending
from Cape Cod to Newfoundland, were the feeding
grounds of enormous masses of cod, herring, and other fish,
which swarmed in the cold waters of the Labrador current.
If no precious metals rewarded search, if the beaver retreated
farther and farther into the wilderness, if the soil gave but
grudging yield, here, at least, was limitless wealth. The industry,
thanks to the combination of shoals and icy waters,
became the corner-stone of the prosperity of New England;
and in the colonial history of that section, commerce smells as
strongly of fish as theology does of brimstone. Together with
lumber, fish became the staple of exchange with old England
and the rich West Indian settlements, and the industry bred
a hardy race of seamen, who manned New England's merchant
fleet, and, later, the American navy.<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c014'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In two other aspects the sea exerted marked influence upon
both the discovery and the settlement of the new lands, as well
as upon their later history. The fact that America and Europe
are separated by three thousand miles of water must be considered
in relation to culture at various periods; for geographic
factors are relative, and not absolute, in their historic connotations.
Countries may be said to be habitable or uninhabitable,
distances to lengthen or shorten, heights to rise or fall,
according to the measure of man's control over nature at any
given time. As a distinguished French geographer has said:
<span lang="fr">“Tout se transforme autour de nous; tout diminue ou s'accroît.
Rien n'est vraiment immobile et invariable.”</span><a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c014'><sup>[17]</sup></a> Increase in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>speed of vessels, with increased storage capacity for food and
water, is equivalent to an actual reduction of the distance in
miles; and, measured by the standards of modern ships in
speed alone, without considering other factors, we may say
that twenty to thirty thousand miles of uncharted seas had
kept America hidden from European eyes.</p>

<p class='c001'>Across this wide expanse, in the latitude of Europe, the
currents of both air and water set from America toward the
Old World, and almost precluded the possibility, under primitive
conditions, of European voyaging and discovery. North
of this eastward track, however, lie not only the stepping-stones
of the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and Greenland, but, once at Iceland,
the prevailing wind carries the European mariner to Greenland,
whence the Labrador current leads him close inshore and
along the coasts of Canada and New England.<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c014'><sup>[18]</sup></a> To the south
of the central eastward track, is the zone of the trade-winds
and the great westward flowing equatorial current; and there,
again, we find island stepping-stones. Thus nature clearly indicated
the two ways by which America might be found; and,
for long, the routes followed were the northerly one to the
Newfoundland fisheries and New England, and the southerly
one to the Canaries, the West Indies, and, thence, to Virginia.
The earliest English efforts at colonization in North America
were at the two points lying nearest to England by wind and
ocean current.</p>

<p class='c001'>One other feature in the geographic control over the life of
New England may here be noted. The main imports of England
were naturally those commodities which she did not produce
herself, and these were found in the southern and West
Indian colonies rather than in New England, whose fish and
cereals competed with similar products in the home market.
Destined, from her position and other geographic factors, to
occupy the leading place among the colonies in trade and commerce,
New England was thus forced to find outlets for her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>products in intercolonial and foreign trade, rather than in that
with England. In order to pay for the manufactured and other
articles imported from the old country, she exported, in turn,
not to that country, as, in the main, did the other colonies, but
to her sister colonies and to foreign ports. According to the
accepted economic theories of the colonizing period, this not
only made her less valuable to the mother-country, but would
evidently give her a considerable interest in breaking those
laws for regulating commerce that were the logical expression
of the current imperial theory. If we consider, therefore, the
nature of the commodities she produced, the competing character
of her trade, the democratic ideas of the groups of self-governing
land-holders, such as the soil and climate combined
to develop, and the economic beliefs of the day, it becomes
evident that, when a heavy strain should be put upon the imperial
structure, the tendency to break would be likely to appear
first in New England.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the foregoing sketch, an attempt has been made to trace,
very briefly, some of the influences of geography upon Puritan
development in New England. The early history of all peoples
is largely to be found in their struggle against their environment,
and its effect upon them. These effects are subtle and
far-reaching, and, in connection with them, it may not be
wholly idle to speculate upon what might have been had events
followed a slightly different course. Had the Jamestown
settlers planted themselves upon the coast of Massachusetts,
they would probably have failed. On the other hand, had the
Pilgrims and Puritans, as both seriously thought of doing,
settled in the tropics, where the nature of the climate and the
soil would have turned the scale for slavery, where the conditions
of life would have strongly combatted their notions of
town and church, and where luxury and easy living would have
been quickly attained by their inherent energy, what would
then have become of what we call the New England element in
our national life? To carry the speculation far would be
futile, but it serves to bring out into somewhat clearer relief
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>the influences of the geographic environment upon those colonists
whose history it is our task to trace.</p>

<p class='c001'>The distant land to which they came was not an uninhabited
wilderness. They found there, as occupants of the
soil, an unknown race, in the lower stage of barbarism, with
whom they had to contend for its possession. With a few notable
exceptions, the relations of the whites with the Indians
were the same in all the colonies. The natives were traded
with, fought with, occasionally preached to, and then, as far as
possible, exterminated. “The precepts Christianity delivers,”
wrote Lord Bryce, of the relations between advanced and backward
races, “might have been expected to soften the feelings
and tame the pride of the stronger race. It must, however,
be admitted that in all or nearly all the countries ... Christianity
... has failed to impress the lessons of human equality
and brotherhood upon the whites.... Their sense of scornful
superiority resists its precepts.”<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c014'><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This comment, which is only too true in the present day,
was still more true in the seventeenth century. Even in history,
the Indian has usually been treated as, at best, a picturesque
element, to give color to the somewhat drab homespun
of the colonial story; while the Indian policy of the several
colonies, the history of the Indian trade, and the influence of
the Indian upon the settler, yet await adequate treatment.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Indian's character and mental traits, which were frequently
misinterpreted, were those to be expected in a savage
at his stage of culture. If, on the one hand, he was not the
noble being painted by Cooper, on the other, he was not the
demon often conceived. Indeed, in scanning the list of epithets
hurled at him by some of New England's ministers of Christ,
one is reminded of Professor Murray's comment on the Greek
story of Œdipus. “Unnatural affection, child-murder, father-murder,
incest, a great deal of hereditary cursing, a double
fratricide and a violation of the sanctity of dead bodies—when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>one reads,” writes this scholar, “such a list of charges brought
against any tribe or people, either in ancient or in modern
times, one can hardly help concluding that somebody wanted
to annex their land.”<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c014'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The nature of the life the Indian led inclined to render him
improvident and lazy, although capable at need of great exertion
and endurance. He was dirty in his person, and yet
possessed of a childish vanity as to his appearance. The popular
idea of him as reserved, silent, and dignified probably
came from the fact that his etiquette demanded that he thus
appear on ceremonial occasions, social or religious, and it was
at such times, at first, that the whites usually saw him. In
reality, in his ordinary life, he was a sociable body, cheerful and
chatty, with a considerable sense of humor, fond of punning
and joking.<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c014'><sup>[21]</sup></a> Hysterical in his nervous make-up, he was peculiarly
liable to suggestion and religious excitement. As he was
passionate and quick to take offense, like other savages and
children, public opinion demanded that he seek revenge; and
when a crime was committed against any member of a clan,
the punishment of the guilty party became the duty of every
other member. Under the compelling influence of such a code,
the individual may often have had to appear more revengeful
than he really was; and, as a matter of fact, the old law of an
eye for an eye had already become softened by possibilities of
compensation, through adoption or otherwise, even in the case
of murder. Although prisoners of war were frequently tortured
with fiendish ingenuity before being killed, in this case,
also, adoption offered a milder alternative, often exercised.
Scalping, as a sign of victory, was supposed to be performed
only on the dead, and, although this theory did not always
hold good,<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c014'><sup>[22]</sup></a> it must be remembered that the whites, as well as
the Indians, engaged in the practice, with the difference that,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>while the natives did it for honor, the settlers did it for money.
New England men, and even New England women, sold scalps
to the authorities at so much a head; and, among the Pennsylvanians,
prices went as high as fifty dollars for a female scalp,
and one hundred and thirty for that of a boy under ten.<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c014'><sup>[23]</sup></a>
With the Indian, it was merely a custom to which he had become
inured; and it should be noted that he wore his own hair
accordingly, and carefully refrained from shaving the scalp-lock,
which it might be his enemy's glory, some day, to remove.</p>

<p class='c001'>The influence of a formal code is seen also in his bearing of
pain. In public, he would suffer torture of the most excruciating
sort with complete stoicism, as required by the opinion
of his fellows; whereas, in private, when not thus sustained,
he would be childish in his self-abandon over the tooth-ache
or other discomfort.<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c014'><sup>[24]</sup></a> Hospitality was a cardinal virtue, to
such an extent that “in some languages there was but one
word both for generosity and bravery, and either was a sure
avenue to distinction.”<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c014'><sup>[25]</sup></a> Fierce and bloodthirsty in war, in
domestic life he was affectionate to an extreme, especially
toward children. His code, though different from the white
man's, was apparently adhered to quite as strictly; but, when
the two were brought into contact, the vices inherent in each
tended to develop, and it is natural that the weaker came to be
considered hopelessly lazy, cruel, drunken, and untrustworthy.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the time of discovery, the natives encountered along the
Atlantic coast had advanced from savagery to the lower
status of barbarism, and were still in the Stone Age. Although
agriculture was practised to a considerable extent, the Indians,
having no domestic animals, were still dependent upon the
chase for a material part of their diet, and so must be considered
as in the hunting stage, their advancement in culture
being limited by that condition.<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c014'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Their political organization was much misunderstood by the
whites, with disastrous results. The settlers, utterly ignorant
of savage life, tried to interpret such things as they saw in
terms of their own institutions; whence came the kings, princes,
and nobles, who parade the pages of our early writers. It is
needless to say that nothing in Indian society in any way corresponded
to these terms; and the failure of the whites to apprehend
that Indian institutions had almost nothing in common
with their own was the source of endless trouble and much
needless bloodshed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among such Indians as had attained to some degree of social
organization, which included the majority on the continent
and all of those with whom the settlers came in contact, the
primary unit was the clan, or gens. Within a clan, or gens,
everyone was, or was supposed to be, descended from a common
ancestor, and thus related to all the others—in the
former the line of descent being traced through the female, and
in the latter, through the male. Otherwise, the two organizations
were identical, and we shall, therefore, speak in terms of
the clan only. Clan members were absolutely forbidden to
intermarry; they had the right to elect and depose the sachem
and chiefs, to bestow names upon individuals, and to adopt
strangers. They possessed common religious observances,
were buried in one place, had mutual rights of inheritance in
the property of deceased members, were under obligation to
defend one another, and participated in the council.<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c014'><sup>[27]</sup></a> The
latter was essentially democratic, every man and woman in the
clan having a voice, the sachem and chiefs being elected and
deposed at will. The sachem was a civil officer having nothing
to do with war, and the office was hereditary within the
clan, though the succeeding relative, usually a brother or
nephew, was elected. Chief was a very vague term, merely indicating
one who had been elected for some special fitness, the
number of chiefs being roughly proportioned to the size of the
clan. Both sachem and chiefs attended the larger council of
the tribe.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>While articles of personal property, such as clothes or weapons,
were owned by the individual, the title to all land was in
the clan, and the individual had the right of use only. Ownership
in fee by the individual, as practised by the whites, was
not known at all to the natives, nor was the native institution
understood by the whites during the first years, so that the
so-called land sales by the Indians were the cause of constant
misunderstandings and ill-feeling.<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c014'><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Generally, each clan possessed a totem, or animal, from
which it derived its name. These names, however, were not,
as a rule, the common ones for the animal or object, but denoted
a characteristic feature or haunt, and were less childish than
they have been made to seem. Thus the Turtle Clan did not
use the common word, <i>ha'nowa</i>, but <i>hadiniaden</i>, “they have
upright necks.”<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c014'><sup>[29]</sup></a> A curious importance was attached by the
Indian to the names of individuals, and that first given in infancy
was usually changed at puberty, and even at other times.
Certain names were given only in certain clans, and the individual
had property rights in his own name, which he could
lend, sell, or even pawn.</p>

<p class='c001'>The clan was thus the Indian's little world. To its organization,
and his own position in it, he owed almost all that made
life worth living from the social standpoint—his name, to
which a potent influence attached, his ceremonial rights, his
rights of inheritance, his property rights in land, his obligation
to defend and succor his fellow clansmen, his right to be protected
in return, and, finally, his political right to elect and
depose his sachem and chiefs. Notwithstanding the extremely
democratic and individualistic nature of Indian society, and
the looseness of its political organization, the influence of the
clan sentiment upon the individual must have had enormous
weight.<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c014'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Above the clan was the tribe, which is difficult to define, but
clearly marked, and which was the highest form of organization
ordinarily attained by the natives—confederacies, such
as the Iroquois, being exceptional. Tribal organization is
more obvious to the untrained observer than that of clans, and
whenever the settlers found a body of natives possessing an
apparent degree of independence or territorial isolation, they
gave them a tribal designation, derived from the dialect, locality,
or name of the leader, though such designations are of
almost no value for scientific classification.<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c014'><sup>[31]</sup></a> The tribe, which
was composed of several clans, may be said to have had a
common religious worship, a name, a definite territory, and
the exclusive use of a dialect, together with the right to invest
and depose the sachems and chiefs of the several clans.<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c014'><sup>[32]</sup></a> These
chiefs and sachems formed the tribal council, which controlled
the tribe's “foreign policy,” sent and received ambassadors,
made alliances, and declared war and peace, although it was
a weak organization for military purposes. The assumed natural
condition was war, not peace, and every tribe was theoretically
at war with every other, unless a specific treaty of
peace had been made. On the other hand, there was no forced
military service, and public opinion or personal inclination
alone sent the warrior along the war-path. Any person could
organize an expedition at any time, and service was voluntary,
operations, as a rule, being conducted suddenly, secretly, and
on a small scale.</p>

<p class='c001'>As among all primitive peoples, the food-quest was one of the
dominating factors in the Indian's mode of life. This included
hunting, both with weapons and with traps, fishing, by net and
line, and agriculture, with primitive implements and manuring.
Game was fairly abundant for a sparse population, and the
bays, rivers, and lakes swarmed with many sorts of fish. Maize,
the fundamental food-crop of all eastern North America, was
raised as far north as northern Maine; pumpkins, beans, and
other native vegetables were cultivated also, and tobacco
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>was grown even beyond the northern limits of maize. Not
only these crops, but the whole complex of cultivation which
the Indians had developed, was of profound importance to the
settlers, who, it may be noted, also adopted in its entirety the
native method of making maple-sugar.</p>

<p class='c001'>In many cases, the quest of these various foods gave rise to
seasonal migrations, from which was derived the false idea that
the Indians were nomadic. Although this was not true, they
nearly always did have two, and even three, places of residence—one
in the summer, conveniently located for their fields of
corn; one in the winter, in some sheltered valley; and, perhaps,
one for the fall months, for the hunting.<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c014'><sup>[33]</sup></a> Moreover, as Williams
tells us, “the abundance of fleas” in their homes would
occasionally make them “remove on a sudden” to a more exclusive
spot. Most communities had one or more fortified enclosures,
consisting of from one to a score of houses inside a
stockade, which were resorted to in time of danger, and frequently
formed their winter dwellings.<a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c014'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In traveling, birch-bark or dugout canoes were used along the
coasts and water-courses, and, on the land, well-established
trails extended, with few breaks, across the length and breadth
of the continent.<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c014'><sup>[35]</sup></a> The most noted of these in New England,
and among the earliest used by the settlers, were the Bay Path
and Old Connecticut Path, the latter of which ran from what
are now Boston and Cambridge, through Marlborough, Grafton,
Oxford, and Springfield, to Albany, where it joined the
great Iroquois trail along the Mohawk Valley to Niagara.<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c014'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In their travel, as in their domestic life, labor was more or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>less equally divided between the sexes; and, although woman's
position was subordinate, it is a mistake to paint her as drudge,
toiling for a lazy master. In building the house, for example,
the man cut and set the poles, on which the woman arranged the
covering of mats or bark. The tillage of the soil in comparative
safety was her share, while the man undertook the more
dangerous work of hunting. While she had the care of the
household, and the nurture of the children, he laboriously
chipped the stone implements used in war and the chase, built
the boats, and, in some cases, made the women's clothes as
well as his own. The boys and old men helped her about the
crops; to the other males were intrusted the duties of a warrior,
and the conducting of public business and ceremonials, including
the memorizing of the tribal records, treaties, and rituals.<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c014'><sup>[37]</sup></a>
In the production of household goods, the women made baskets
and mats; the men, dishes and pots and spoons.<a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c014'><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Such a division of labor was calculated to provide the community,
under the conditions of its savage and war-like life,
with the largest possible measure of food and protection, and
did not indicate a degraded position for woman. On the contrary,
descent was usually traced through her, and the titles
of the chiefs of the clans belonged to her, as did the family
lodge and all its furnishings. She had ownership rights in the
tribal lands; possessed the children exclusively; had the right
of selecting from her sons candidates for the chieftaincy, of preventing
them from going on the war-path, and of adopting
strangers into the clan. She also had other powers, including
that of life and death over alien prisoners, and was not seldom
elected a chief or sachem herself. Among the Iroquois, the
penalty for killing a woman was twice that exacted for a man;
and it is noteworthy that no attempt against the chastity of a
white woman prisoner has been charged against the savage—a
record distinctly better than that of the white settlers. Although
polygamy was not forbidden, it was rare except in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>case of chiefs, priests, and shamans (or medicine-men), and
monogamic unions were the rule. The tie, however, was loose,
and could readily be dissolved by either party, the children, in
any case, remaining with the mother. Constancy was expected,
and its breach, particularly in the case of the woman,
was severely punished. Chastity was not expected before
marriage, but, as Wissler points out, it was essential in certain
religious ceremonies, and so may have been an ideal.<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c014'><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In their relations with their children, we find some of the
highest traits in the character of the natives. Both parents
were, as a rule, excessively fond of their offspring, and boys
and girls were carefully instructed. In general, moral suasion
alone was used; force but rarely. The girls, from an early
age, were taught sewing, weaving, cooking, and the other household
arts; the boys were initiated into the methods of hunting,
fishing, war, and government. Etiquette was carefully observed
by all, in such matters as sitting, standing, precedence
in walking, interrupting a speaker, respect to elders, passing
between a person and the fire, and the other niceties of life
according to native standards.</p>

<p class='c001'>The New England Indians had made but slight progress in
the arts. The character of the native music is even yet not
well understood, and much preliminary work remains to be
done before any generalizations can be made.<a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c014'><sup>[40]</sup></a> We know,
however, that in the same song the instrumental and vocal
rhythms were different, and that there was a characteristic one
for every ceremony. Music, indeed, was an important element
in life, all ceremonies, public and private, being accompanied
by songs, which were the property of clans, societies, or individuals,
and were bought and sold. In design, both in pottery
and weaving, the patterns used were geometrical only, and
simple; but the later New England native pottery showed the
influence of the superior art of the Iroquois, in form as well as
decoration.<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c014'><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>In their economic life, the most interesting feature was the
use of wampum, or shell-beads, as a primitive medium of exchange.
These little black or white cylinders, of which the
former were worth twice as much as the latter, were made with
great care from certain shells found along the coast. Besides
their use as currency, they were prized by the Indians as ornament,
and were strung into belts, to perform their well-known
symbolic and historical functions.<a id='r42'></a><a href='#f42' class='c014'><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>One of the most popular misconceptions of the Indian is
that of his belief in a “Great Spirit.” Nowhere in American
aboriginal life do we find anything approaching such a conception.
The Indian was in the animistic stage of religious belief.
The <em>manitou</em> of the Algonquins, like the <em>orenda</em> of the Iroquois,
was merely the magic power which might exist in objects,
forces, animals, and even men, superior to man's natural qualities;
and the Indian's religious beliefs centred about his relations
to some embodied form of this power. He believed in
good spirits and bad, which could be controlled or invoked by
prayer, offerings, charms, or incantations, and had developed
a large body of myths to explain the universe and his relation
to it. No moral concept attached to any of his deities, nor had
he developed any idea of future rewards and punishments,
although there was a belief in some vague form of life after
bodily death. The rites of their primitive religion were in the
hands of priests, whose power and influence increase as we
proceed southward toward the highly developed ritualism of the
Incas and their neighboring civilizations. The priest, acting
for the tribe, must not be confused with the “medicine-man,”
who depended solely upon his personal ability to establish relations
with the magic powers, which he won by extraordinary
experiences derived from fasting, prayer, and nervous excitement.</p>

<p class='c001'>The exact classification of the Indians by cultural, archæological,
linguistic, and other tests, is a matter of considerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>difficulty, but the linguistic, on the whole, is the best. Judged
by all of them, however, the aborigines of New England possessed
a high degree of unity.<a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c014'><sup>[43]</sup></a> At the time of settlement, the
entire country along the coast, from Maryland to Hudson
Strait, was occupied by natives of the widely distributed Algonquin
stock, except for a small number of Beothuks in Newfoundland,
and the Esquimaux along the Labrador shore.<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c014'><sup>[44]</sup></a>
The Algonquins also extended westward to the Mississippi, and
two-thirds of the way across Canada. Imbedded in this otherwise
homogeneous mass, the great body of the Iroquois dwelt
on both sides of the St. Lawrence, surrounded Lake Erie, and
covered all central Pennsylvania and the state of New York,
except the lower Hudson. Although not included in the confines
of New England, the influence of this highly organized and warlike
confederacy was felt far beyond their bounds in every
direction.<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c014'><sup>[45]</sup></a> It is impossible to state the numbers which composed
the New England tribes at the coming of the whites.
Perhaps the original settlers faced in all, throughout New England,
five thousand warriors, although this may be too high a
figure, and all estimates can be only guesses.<a id='r46'></a><a href='#f46' class='c014'><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Such, in outline, was the Indian when he met the astonished
and anxious gaze of the first settlers. Enough has been said to
show that in the contact of the races an irrepressible conflict
was bound to develop. Even had the savage never received
any but kind and just treatment from his white neighbor, it is
improbable that he could have readjusted his entire life so as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>to compete with, or to accept, civilization. That test, however,
was never made. To say that his lands were bought, and
that, therefore, he was justly treated, is a mockery. To have
expected sympathy, understanding, and justice in the situation
as it developed in the seventeenth century is asking too
much, both of human nature and of the period. Indeed, it is
questionable whether, in the competition between races of
higher and lower civilizations, when the former intrude upon
the lands of the latter, justice, in its strictest sense, is ever possible.
One cannot believe that the world would have been
either better or happier had the land which to-day supports a
hundred million self-governing people been left to the half-million
barbarians who barely gained a subsistence from it four
centuries ago. Man, in the individual treatment of his fellow,
is, indeed, bound by the laws of justice and of right; but in the
larger processes of history we are confronted by problems that
the ethics of the individual fail to solve. The Indian in the
American forest, and the Polynesian in his sunny isle, share, in
the moral enigma of their passing, the mystery of the vanished
races of man and brute, which have gone down in the struggle
for existence in geological or historic ages, in what, one would
fain believe, is a universe governed by moral law.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER II<br> <br> STAKING OUT CLAIMS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>As we saw in the first chapter, nature had clearly defined the
paths by which America might be found. The time when the
discovery would be made was almost as definitely determined
by events in the Old World. For countless centuries, Europe,
by many routes and through many intermediaries, had traded
with the vaguely localized countries of the Orient. Throughout
the Middle Ages, not only had she been dependent on the
East for most of her luxuries, but many of these, from long
usage, had become necessities.<a id='r47'></a><a href='#f47' class='c014'><sup>[47]</sup></a> About the beginning of the
fourteenth century, this commerce, “the oldest, the most extensive,
and the most lucrative trade known to Europe,” began
to be interfered with by the internal changes in the East,
mainly due to conquests by the Ottoman Turks. Beginning
about 1300, marked by the fall of Constantinople in 1453, and
continuing until all the seaports of the eastern Mediterranean,
including those of Egypt, were in their possession by 1522, the
process was a gradual one. At first uneasy, then alarmed,
finally facing commercial ruin by the almost complete strangulation
of her Oriental trade, Europe struggled frantically against
geographical conditions, in her efforts to find a new and unimpeded
route to the East.</p>

<p class='c001'>During the latter part of the same period, geographical science
had been making many strides; while the theory of the
earth's sphericity had been held, by some at least, since the
days of Plato. After nearly two thousand years, motives developed
which led men to turn that idea into action by use of
the new discoveries, and in one generation Columbus sailed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>west to America, and Da Gama east to India, and Magellan
circumnavigated the globe. The thought advanced by philosophy,
denied by common sense, and fought by the Church,
finally wrought the greatest change yet known in the world's
history through the commonplace necessities of trade.</p>

<p class='c001'>Voyaging toward the northwest, in the hope of finding the
treasures of the East, had possibly been undertaken annually
from 1491, by certain citizens of Bristol, England, when the
Italian, John Cabot, domiciled in their city, applied to King
Henry VII for letters patent “for the discovery of new and
unknown lands.” The Cabots themselves left no account of
their voyages, and the story must be made up from a few contemporary
documents, some hearsay evidence, and a large
amount of inference. Apparently, John Cabot sailed, some
time in 1497, under the patent granted to himself and his sons,
and by the end of August was back in England, after a voyage
of several months. The location of the landfall, made June
24, is wholly uncertain.<a id='r48'></a><a href='#f48' class='c014'><sup>[48]</sup></a> A second voyage was made the following
year, and a considerable part of the northeast coast
appears to have been explored, although it is impossible to
place the limits of the discovery. Whether he was accompanied
on either or both of the voyages by his son Sebastian is
uncertain, but it is probable that he was.<a id='r49'></a><a href='#f49' class='c014'><sup>[49]</sup></a> As for the rest, one
is tempted to echo Dawson's remark, that “as for John Cabot,
Sebastian says he died, which is one of the few undisputed facts
in the discussion.”<a id='r50'></a><a href='#f50' class='c014'><sup>[50]</sup></a> To us, the importance of the voyage lies
in the fact that upon it England based her claims, in later
times, to a portion of the New World, though she made no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>effort to colonize for another eighty years, and the immediate
effect of the discovery was not great—The times were not yet
ripe. Exploration and land-grabbing were games for kings,
and not for private endeavor, as the merchants of Bristol had
doubtless found; and Henry, as the Milanese ambassador observed,
was “not lavish.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Owing to the great demand for fish in a Catholic Europe,
however, the shores of Newfoundland soon became the accustomed
resort of English, French, and Portuguese.<a id='r51'></a><a href='#f51' class='c014'><sup>[51]</sup></a> The coast
between Canada and Florida, nevertheless, remained practically
unexplored, and the maps of the period either break the continent
into islands, or connect the two known portions by a
fanciful delineation, considered by some students to represent
the eastern coast of Asia.<a id='r52'></a><a href='#f52' class='c014'><sup>[52]</sup></a> Where nothing is certain, all is
possible, and it was thought that the passage to the East, so
vainly sought elsewhere, might yet be found in this unknown
part of the world. In 1524, Verrazano, under the flag of
France, and, a year later, Gomez, under that of Spain, undertook
again the task of finding a westward route to Zipangu and
Cathay. The Frenchman, apparently, coasted northward
from Carolina to Newfoundland, and the Spaniard seems to
have covered part of the same range, though the limits are not
known, nor even the direction in which he sailed.<a id='r53'></a><a href='#f53' class='c014'><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The three main contestants for empire in North America had
now appeared. Spain, France, and England had all planted
their flags upon our shores, although their future struggles were
as yet hardly foreshadowed. The fishing grounds, on the high
seas and far from the routes of Spain's gold-laden galleons, were
open to all, though the English seem early to have established
some sort of authority over the rough fishermen of the nations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>gathered there.<a id='r54'></a><a href='#f54' class='c014'><sup>[54]</sup></a> The continent itself, however, was merely an
unwelcome barrier, save the Spanish possessions in the south,
with which, as yet, no other nation had thought of meddling.
Nevertheless, a new era had opened, and commerce, which,
from the dawn of history, had clung to the Mediterranean, now
abandoned that enclosed sea for the open highways of the
world's oceans. The Oriental trade began to flow through new
channels, and Spain, by the conquest of Mexico, in 1522, tapped
unlimited sources of the precious metals. The enormous import
business from the East, formerly concentrated in the hands
of the great mercantile cities of Italy, passed to the Iberian
powers,<a id='r55'></a><a href='#f55' class='c014'><sup>[55]</sup></a> while men's horizons were widened by the new discoveries,
and old established methods, routes, and connections
had received severe shocks. The example of Spain and Portugal
was making other nations dream of gaining fabulous
wealth by finding their way to the riches of the Orient, or gold
in the wilds of America.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the next four centuries, the civilization of Europe, which
throughout the mediæval period had been hemmed within a
narrow region by strong barbaric powers, was able to expand
against almost negligible resistance, until, after having encircled
the world, it is again faced in our own day by a “closed
political system.”<a id='r56'></a><a href='#f56' class='c014'><sup>[56]</sup></a> At the very moment when new forces were
being let loose by the social ferment following the Renaissance
and the Reformation, the new lands offered vents through
which those forces might in part escape, without causing such
explosions as wholly to wreck the social system. Their presence,
or, to phrase it differently, the existence of a practically
unlimited frontier, during the whole of our colonial period, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>one of the great formative elements in our institutions, and in
the relations between the colonies and England.</p>

<p class='c001'>We are so accustomed to think of that country as the great
trading nation and mistress of the seas, that it is hard to conceive
of a time when she had not even faintly dreamed that
her destiny was to be upon the water, when her trade was still
mainly in the hands of foreigners, and she herself was merely a
producer of raw materials for the manufacturers on the continent.
Such, however, was the situation at the opening of the
sixteenth century. Men, indeed, began to talk of the new discoveries,
which were even introduced into the rude theatre of
the time; but, in the main, they stuck to their last, and fished
and grew wool like their fathers. As yet, there was not the
vaguest thought of a colonial empire—only dreams of gold
and spices, and the silent fishermen catching cod.</p>

<p class='c001'>The accession of Elizabeth opened the door to imperial ambition.
Spain was, indeed, at the height of her power, whereas
England's day was yet to come. Elizabeth's resources needed
careful husbanding, and no open breach between the two
countries could be allowed; but political interests were still
European in the minds of statesmen, and peace, though many
times in jeopardy, was not to be broken lightly for what English
seamen might do “beyond the line.” America was a
means to European ends for Spain, and, until the depredations
of the English became so great as to threaten those ends,
murder, robbery, and the looting of cities passed with no action
beyond protests, which Elizabeth met and parried.</p>

<p class='c001'>We must pass by the doings of Hawkins, Drake, and the
other sea-dogs, the whole pack of whom were soon in full cry
after the hated Spaniards in their slow-moving galleons, laden
with the treasure upon which their European power was
nourished. This latter fact was now recognized, and wild and,
perhaps, unlawful as were these English seamen, we must remember
that, unlike common pirates, their depredations were
not alone for private ends, but were blows struck for their religion,
their country, and their queen. Had it not been for
them, the Armada might indeed have been invincible, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>civilization of North America have been Latin instead of Anglo-Saxon.<a id='r57'></a><a href='#f57' class='c014'><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>One of the outstanding characteristics of the later Tudor
period was the remarkable development of individual initiative.
Men were no longer content “ever like sheepe to haunte
one trade,” but in every field of human endeavor were striking
across new paths. It was, moreover, an age of glorious
amateurs. As in the best days of Greece, the bars that bound
the individual within narrow limits of professionalism were
broken asunder. It was as if to the nation's mature powers
had suddenly been added the gift of youth. It was a cry of
youth which Thorne uttered when he swept away all objections
to the dangers of the Northwest Passage with his “there
is no land unhabitable nor sea innavigable.” Elizabeth's well-known
methods, which perhaps temperament, necessity, and
policy all had their share in fashioning, were admirably adapted
to bring out, and to use to the utmost, these qualities in her
subjects. Personal loyalty and individual initiative were
largely fostered in place of taxation and governmental enterprise,
and the patriotism of a united nation rose to new levels.
“He is not worthy to live at all,” wrote Sir Humphrey Gilbert,
in 1576, “that for feare, or danger of death, shunneth his countries
service, and his owne honour.”<a id='r58'></a><a href='#f58' class='c014'><sup>[58]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This growing national feeling was strengthened by religious
motives. The persecutions under Mary, and the tortures of
the Inquisition, to which English sailors were so often subjected
in the ports of Spain, both played their part in the drama
now being enacted. Five thousand English volunteered for
service against the Spaniard in the Netherlands, and the
Queen's hand was being forced by the national feeling that she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>herself had aroused. The conquest of Portugal by Spain, in
1580, nominally transferred to the latter all the colonial possessions
of the entire world she did not already possess, leaving
no room open for other nations, according to Spanish pretensions.
The English government at last spoke, however,
and in the same year, in answer to Spain's demand for the
return of Drake's plunder, announced that Spain “by the law
of nations could not hinder other princes from freely navigating
those seas and transporting colonies to those parts where
the Spaniards do not inhabit; that prescription without possession
availed nothing.”<a id='r59'></a><a href='#f59' class='c014'><sup>[59]</sup></a> The rights of other nations were
definitely settled by the defeat of the Armada eight years later.</p>

<p class='c001'>Business was beginning to improve somewhat after its long
decline. The Muscovy Company had been chartered in 1555,
and trade was seeking those new outlets which Sebastian Cabot
had been recalled from Spain to find; but England felt the
effects of the vast injection of American bullion into the currency
system of Europe later than the continental countries.
After the recoinage of the debased money in 1559, however,
the advance in prices, which had already begun, was very
rapid, with effects upon the country gentry and other classes,
which were to have a marked influence upon American colonization.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the meantime, while Drake was hastening home from the
Pacific in the Pelican, loaded to the gunwales with the spoils
of Spanish treasure-ships, another voyage, the first, except those
of fishermen, since the ill-fated escapade of a London lawyer in
1536, was being made to the shores of Newfoundland. The
motive was the old continuing one of a passage to the Orient
by the northwest, although little is known of its details. The
Queen, however, granted to its leader, Sir Humphrey Gilbert,
a patent to colonize and rule such lands as he might choose
from his new discoveries. This patent, which was issued in
1578, and marked a new epoch in England's American policy,
followed in many respects the charters of the trading companies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>granted by the Crown both previously and subsequently.<a id='r60'></a><a href='#f60' class='c014'><sup>[60]</sup></a>
It had, however, a wholly novel feature in the
clause which permitted Gilbert to transport a colony to his
new possessions. It is probable that this first attempt to plant
an English community beyond the seas was largely based upon
the experience being gained at this very time in the efforts to
colonize Ireland. Sir Humphrey himself, with other west-country
gentlemen, had undertaken to plant colonies on the
Crown lands in Ulster, eleven years before, and various plans
and essays had been made, though unsuccessfully.<a id='r61'></a><a href='#f61' class='c014'><sup>[61]</sup></a> These
colonizing schemes in Ireland were being considered and carried
out during the whole period of the early efforts to plant
colonies in America, and many individuals and city companies
were interested in Irish and American lands at the same time.
Both were almost equally wild and uncivilized, and both were
rich and undeveloped.<a id='r62'></a><a href='#f62' class='c014'><sup>[62]</sup></a> The Irish Plantation Society, formed
in 1613, was a serious rival to the Virginia Company, and diverted
both funds and colonists at a critical time for the American
scheme.<a id='r63'></a><a href='#f63' class='c014'><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The beginnings of the continental American colonies, indeed,
are too apt to be considered as isolated events. Their unique
importance from the standpoint of American history has
tended to obscure their real nature. From that standpoint,
they are naturally viewed as the founding of a great nation;
but if they are considered solely in that relation, not only the
planting of the colonies themselves, but the subsequent history
of their relations with the mother-country, and the whole
course of England's old colonial policy, are bound to be misunderstood.
The American colonies, in their inception, were
largely business ventures of groups of individuals or joint-stock
companies, and, as such, were but episodes in the expansion
of English commerce.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>The patents and charters issued to companies for trade and
discovery, prior to that of Gilbert, contained the germs of most
of the provisions which subsequently found their way into the
charters of American colonies, and the ideas of colonial administration.
Monopoly of trade for a definite time was
naturally granted, as recompense for the great expense and
risk involved in opening new channels. The trades, moreover,
were also justly regulated for the benefit of England rather
than of the few individuals who were shareholders in the enterprises.
Hence, we find stipulations such as that in the Cabot
charter of 1496, requiring all business done under it to pass
through the port of Bristol only; or that in the charter of 1566,
to the Fellowship of English Merchants, requiring that all
goods must be carried solely in English ships, manned for the
most part with English sailors.<a id='r64'></a><a href='#f64' class='c014'><sup>[64]</sup></a> These and other restrictions
were the germs of a domestic economic policy which, although
reasonable enough in its inception, was to be pregnant with
such fatal results when pursued consistently, and without
taking into consideration the altered conditions brought about
by the unexpectedly tremendous growth and political needs of
those particular colonies planted by certain trading companies
or individuals in America.</p>

<p class='c001'>Under the system of international intercourse prevailing in
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it was found necessary to
provide some sort of government and authority for the groups
of English merchants, and their clerks, residing in foreign
countries. The problem was met, in 1404, by Henry IV, who
granted a charter to those resident in the Teutonic countries
of northern Europe, permitting them to meet together to elect
their own governors, and to make their own laws, the king
ratifying and requiring obedience to such legislation in advance.<a id='r65'></a><a href='#f65' class='c014'><sup>[65]</sup></a>
In 1462, Edward IV, in a charter to those resident in
the Netherlands, appointed the governor, but allowed the
merchants to elect twelve “Justiciers,” who were to sit with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>him as a court. The merchants were also to make their own
laws, which, however, had to be approved by the royal governor.
When it was no longer a question of trading in a civilized
country, but of discovering new ones, unoccupied, or occupied
only by heathen, the discoverer was naturally allowed to take
possession in the name of the king, and was enfeoffed with the
new land, the condition of tenure usually being a fifth of the
precious metals found.</p>

<p class='c001'>In these commercial charters, we thus find the germs of the
commonwealth, royal, and proprietary colonies of the seventeenth
century. There was no break at the beginning of
American history. Nor was there any conscious intention
upon England's part of founding an empire. The English
colonies were by-products of British commercial activity, and
English “colonial policy” was but a mere phase of her commercial
policy. It is only by that light that the development of
events can be rightly understood.</p>

<p class='c001'>The lands conveyed to Gilbert were suitable for Englishmen
to dwell in, and to be made valuable would require to be
populated. This, however, raised a new question. Heretofore,
men had lived as merchants in foreign but civilized countries,
or fished or traded in others. If, now, they were to
settle permanently in this barbarous land, would they cease to
be Englishmen without becoming anything else? Elizabeth
cut the knot by decreeing that such new countries should owe
personal allegiance to herself, and, in that way, be united to her
“Realmes of England and Ireland”; and, further, that any one
born in the new lands, or emigrating thither from the old, should
have all the privileges of a free-born native of the Realm.<a id='r66'></a><a href='#f66' class='c014'><sup>[66]</sup></a>
These questions, now first arising, as to whether the settlers in
new lands were within or without the Realm, and, if without,
then whether they could be held as subject to the government
that functioned for the Realm, were to become more and more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>insistent of answer in the days to come. But when Elizabeth
granted her patent to Gilbert, little could any one have realized
the size of England's future empire in America, or that
that empire would be lost by civil war, in part because the answers
to those questions could not be found. The main factor
that gave rise to this distinction between the Realm and the
Dominions, and that was to be primarily responsible for the
failure satisfactorily to adjust the relations between them, was
the physical distance, in terms of the sixteenth, seventeenth,
and eighteenth centuries, by which they were separated.</p>

<p class='c001'>Gilbert's efforts to colonize, however, like those of his half-brother,
Raleigh, resulted only in failure. The time was ill
chosen, as there was still work enough for enterprising spirits,
and the employment of capital, in other directions. Under the
stimulus of the defeat of the Armada, English seamen scoured
the sea in search of Spanish prey, and it has been estimated
that eight hundred Spanish vessels were lost in four years.<a id='r67'></a><a href='#f67' class='c014'><sup>[67]</sup></a> If
in the light of such opportunities, colonizing seemed but a poor
investment, voyaging and discovery, nevertheless, proceeded
at a rapid rate. But New England, in spite of its being so near
the field of English activities in the fisheries, was neglected,
although its coast may occasionally have been visited by enterprising
souls like Richard Strong, who sailed to “Arambec,” in
1593, in search of “sea-Oxen.”<a id='r68'></a><a href='#f68' class='c014'><sup>[68]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The land itself seems not to have been thought worth investigating
until Bartholomew Gosnold made a clandestine voyage
thither, to his own profit, and to Raleigh's annoyance, in
1602. Formerly, this little trading trip of Gosnold's, undertaken
for the Earl of Southampton, Lord Cobham, and others,
was thought to have been a serious attempt at colonization
with the consent of Raleigh, the sphere of operations lying
within the limits of his patent. The voyage thus secured more
attention from historians than it deserved. Apparently some
sort of permanent trading-post was, indeed, intended, as of the
thirty-two persons who went to America, twenty were expected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>to “remayne there for population.”<a id='r69'></a><a href='#f69' class='c014'><sup>[69]</sup></a> None did, however; and
after having visited Massachusetts Bay, christened Cape Cod,
and spent some time on the island of Cuttyhunk, where they
built a fort, and loaded their ship with sassafras, the whole company
returned to England, after an absence of four months.
Raleigh, ignorant of the episode, but finding the “sassephrase”
market taking a sudden drop, investigated, and the fact of the
voyage came to light. Although he confiscated the cargo, he
became reconciled with both Gosnold and his own nephew,
Bartholomew Gilbert, who also had had a hand in the business,
and both were subsequently employed in Virginia.<a id='r70'></a><a href='#f70' class='c014'><sup>[70]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In the following year, Raleigh's consent was obtained by
Hakluyt and some merchants of Bristol, to the sending out of
another expedition, under Martin Pring, with some of Gosnold's
men aboard, for the purposes of trade.<a id='r71'></a><a href='#f71' class='c014'><sup>[71]</sup></a> The little company,
in their two vessels, coasted along the shores of Maine, explored
Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth Harbor, overlooked
by Gosnold, and having loaded their ships with the much-desired
sassafras, went back to England, to confirm Gosnold's
good opinion of the country. This was to receive still further
confirmation from Weymouth two years later.</p>

<p class='c001'>During these two years Elizabeth had died, and Raleigh had
been convicted of treason. Such rights as he may have possessed
to the land of North Virginia were ignored, therefore,
when the Earl of Southampton, Thomas Arundell, and others
dispatched Weymouth to find a suitable place for colonizing in
the parts visited by Gosnold and Pring. This was the real
intent of the expedition, although it was given out that it was
for the discovery of the Northwest Passage.<a id='r72'></a><a href='#f72' class='c014'><sup>[72]</sup></a> There is some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>evidence that the proposed colony was to be for Roman Catholics.
At least, Sir George Peckham and Sir Thomas Gerrard,
who claimed to be assignees of the Gilbert patent, had secured
the privilege for Romanists of becoming colonists, and the Earl
of Southampton and his leading associates in the present venture
were of that faith.<a id='r73'></a><a href='#f73' class='c014'><sup>[73]</sup></a> Weymouth spent about a month on
the coast, exploring the shores about the St. George's Islands
and the river of the same name.<a id='r74'></a><a href='#f74' class='c014'><sup>[74]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The English, however, had not been the only explorers upon
the New England coast, nor to them only had it begun to appeal
as a possible place for colonizing. For the French, as well as
the English, the sixteenth century in America had been a period
of exploration, of staking out of vague claims, and of unsuccessful
efforts to establish permanent settlements. The first decade
of the seventeenth was to witness the success of both nations in
the latter undertaking, the English at Jamestown in 1607, and
the French at Quebec but one year later, so close was the race
between them. In the territory of New England, however,
both nations were to try, and fail, within the same period; and
citizens of both countries had already, from time to time, received
grants of undefined extension in that general part of the
world, when finally a charter with definite bounds was assigned
by the French King to the Sieur de Monts, in 1603. This grant
embraced all the territory between the 40th and 46th degrees of
latitude, or from Philadelphia to Montreal.</p>

<p class='c001'>The issuance of this patent was immediately followed by an
attempt at settlement, de Monts and Champlain, both of whom
had previously been in Canada, sailing with a hundred and
twenty men in the spring following the receipt of the grant.
Buildings were erected, and the first winter passed on the island
of St. Croix, in the mouth of the river of the same name, which
empties into Passamaquoddy Bay.<a id='r75'></a><a href='#f75' class='c014'><sup>[75]</sup></a> It was thus the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>authorized attempt to colonize any part of New England. The
choice of a site had been unfortunate, and in the following
spring, the colony removed to Nova Scotia, where it lasted two
years more before the cancellation of the grant resulted in its
abandonment. A lively and entertaining account of life in the
colony was written by a genial lawyer, who was one of its
members, and the attention with which American affairs were
then being watched is indicated by the appearance of an English
translation in the same year in which the original came out in
Paris.<a id='r76'></a><a href='#f76' class='c014'><sup>[76]</sup></a> During the three years of his stay, Champlain was indefatigable
in exploring the coast, making three principal
voyages along the shores of New England, which he described
and mapped as far south as the present settlement of Chatham,
in Massachusetts.</p>

<p class='c001'>The coast of Maine and the shores of Massachusetts Bay were
carefully studied for sites for settlement, and the former was
for long to form a debatable land between French and English.
These years also saw the foundation laid of the friendship between
French and Indian, which was to cost the English dear.
De Monts's patent contemplated trade with the natives, rather
than an agricultural colony; and the French empire in America,
as has already been noted, consisted mainly of a series of trading-posts.
It was to the interest of the French that the Indian
should remain, as he himself wished, a hunter; whereas the
growth of the English agricultural colonies denied him the possibility
of continuing his savage life, without, on the other hand,
absorbing him into civilization. It was not merely that the
French, in the main, were tactful and friendly, accepting the
Indian as he was, and even intermarrying, while the English
were harsh and disdainful. It may be said that one Indian required
to sustain his life approximately as many square miles
as the English agriculturist, with his domestic animals, needed
acres. On the other hand, the uses to which the French put
the soil were identical with those for which it served the savage.
The English, indeed, “bought” land, which the French never
did; but the French and the Indian shared the soil to the profit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>of both, while the English deprived the native of his means of
subsistence, in exchange for coats and beads.<a id='r77'></a><a href='#f77' class='c014'><sup>[77]</sup></a> Not that they
did so intentionally; but the consequence was inevitable. Nor
was it the Indian alone who was to fall before the farmer and
founder of towns. The French <span lang="fr"><i>coureurs des bois</i></span>, and traders in
the scattered posts, were likewise to fall and, in part, for the
same reason.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nevertheless, at the time of the first authorized English
attempt to colonize New England, the French were, if anything,
ahead in the race. Champlain's knowledge of the coast
and its possibilities was quite as accurate, probably, as that of
Gosnold or Pring or Weymouth, though English writers usually
give many pages to the latter trio while dismissing Champlain
in a line or two. A definite grant of the territory had been
made, and the first colony of their hereditary enemy was seemingly
successfully started within the limits of the English
patent, when King James affixed his signature to that document.
A struggling little settlement in Virginia, however, was
to prove the undoing of the French in the north, and win the
New England coast for the English, though not without further
effort on the part of its future settlers. But, whatever the
local successes of French or English, it must not be forgotten
that the colonies of both nations were mere pawns in the
game of European policy, and that the allegiance of the colonist
was to be determined in the last analysis, not by their own
comparative strength on faraway shores, but by the strength
which the two nations could put forth in their navies on the sea.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER III<br> <br> THE RACE FOR EMPIRE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>During the period upon which our story now enters, all of
North America was claimed by the three contestants for empire—Spain,
England, and France. The claims of the first
covered the entire western world beyond the line established
by the treaty of Tordesillas; while those of the other two are
indicated, at least as to their minimum extent, by the patents
granted. Adrian Gilbert, in his application to Queen Elizabeth,
had asked leave to “inhabit and enjoy” all places discovered
between the equator and the North Pole;<a id='r78'></a><a href='#f78' class='c014'><sup>[78]</sup></a> and although
these limits are nowhere given in any single charter,
those granted to various companies show English claims extending
from at least 10° to 52° North Latitude, or from Panama
to Labrador.<a id='r79'></a><a href='#f79' class='c014'><sup>[79]</sup></a> Following the difficulties of colonizing in Maine
and Nova Scotia, mentioned in the last chapter, the French
King granted to Madame de Guercheville all of the continent
from Florida to the St. Lawrence, thus overlapping the Spanish
and English claims.<a id='r80'></a><a href='#f80' class='c014'><sup>[80]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The title to newly acquired lands, originally deriving validity
from Papal sanction, even in the eyes of Englishmen,
had gradually come to rest upon the right of discovery.<a id='r81'></a><a href='#f81' class='c014'><sup>[81]</sup></a> This
theory was based upon the principle of Roman Law that the
finder could appropriate what belonged to no one. A heathen
was considered as <span lang="la"><i>nullus</i></span>, hence his property had no owner, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>American soil could be appropriated by whoever first found it.
Although it was agreed by all that discovery must be consummated
by possession and use, there were two very difficult
questions, as to which the law was silent, in connection with
the new situations now arising. One of these was the length
of time which might elapse between discovery and taking
possession, before the claim should become invalid through
failure to consummate the discovery; while the other was that
of the extent of territory involved by the above acts.<a id='r82'></a><a href='#f82' class='c014'><sup>[82]</sup></a> The
claims of the three contestants were preposterous, though no
one more so than another, perhaps; and, in the absence of any
superior authority, it is difficult to see how the matter could
have been settled otherwise than by power of the sword, which
thus replaced the Pope as arbiter. At the time we are now
considering, it would seem as if, theoretically, England's claim
to any part of the New World were the least valid of the three.
Although it was necessarily based solely on the voyage of Cabot,
she had made no effort to colonize for nearly ninety years, and
as yet had failed to do so successfully. To the south, Spanish
titles were, in part, unassailable;<a id='r83'></a><a href='#f83' class='c014'><sup>[83]</sup></a> while in the north, French
claims were being made good by the struggling colony at Port
Royal, and by scattered traders in furs.</p>

<p class='c001'>The treaty of peace with Spain, in 1604, which followed almost
automatically upon the accession of James to the English
throne, changed the situation in important respects with reference
to the success of English colonization. Privateering,
which, in spite of many brilliant exploits, had become “a sordid
and prosaic business,” and decreasingly profitable, came to a
legal end temporarily under the English flag. It is true that
certain of the larger venturers in the trade merely flew the
Dutch flag instead, and continued their depredations; but the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>calling no longer offered its former opportunities, either for
restless spirits or for the employment of capital. The more
legitimate commerce with the Spanish possessions, such as the
import of salt from Venezuela, which had grown to large proportions
during the war, was also ended by the terms of the
treaty, which completely surrendered English rights of trade
with the Indies.<a id='r84'></a><a href='#f84' class='c014'><sup>[84]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Meanwhile, the amount of capital seeking investment had
become large, and owing to the enormous increase of bullion,
the changed feeling in regard to the taking of interest, and
other causes, it was rapidly growing larger.<a id='r85'></a><a href='#f85' class='c014'><sup>[85]</sup></a> It was also becoming
more fluid, as was labor, likewise. Contemporary,
as well as many modern, authorities, have considered England
as suffering from over-population at this time; but it is
doubtful if this were so; and it is probable that the material
for colonization came rather from “the displacement and disturbance
of population” than from its growth.<a id='r86'></a><a href='#f86' class='c014'><sup>[86]</sup></a> Not only
the substitution, to a considerable extent, of sheep-grazing for
farming, and the inclosure of the common lands, but the
gradual breaking up of the whole mediæval system of trade and
conditions of labor, had resulted in an extraordinary amount
of idleness and vagabondage for several generations.<a id='r87'></a><a href='#f87' class='c014'><sup>[87]</sup></a> During
the same period had occurred also the enormous rise in prices,
and in the cost of living, with results very similar to those
which we are now experiencing.<a id='r88'></a><a href='#f88' class='c014'><sup>[88]</sup></a> As to-day, they were severely
felt by people with approximately fixed incomes; and the
country gentry in particular, with their lands let on long leases,
suffered greatly. During the war, younger sons, and the more
enterprising of all classes, had had an opportunity to gain a
living by embarking on a career in privateering or other warlike
pursuits; but with the coming of peace, those openings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>were for the most part closed to them. On the other hand, the
scale of living had risen rapidly, and extravagance required a
much greater outlay than in former days. “In a time wherein
all things are grown to most excessive prices,” wrote Harrison
as early as 1577, “we do yet find the means to obtain and
achieve such furniture as heretofore hath been unpossible.”<a id='r89'></a><a href='#f89' class='c014'><sup>[89]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>During the war, moreover, the older channels of legitimate
trade had, for the most part, been closed to the English merchant,
who found himself cut off “from Spain, Portugal, Barbary,
the Levant, and, to a considerable extent, from Poland,
Denmark, and Germany.”<a id='r90'></a><a href='#f90' class='c014'><sup>[90]</sup></a> The seventeen years prior to the
death of Elizabeth had been years of depressed business, now,
in turn, to be followed by a like period of prosperity, while
trade continued fairly good until 1636.<a id='r91'></a><a href='#f91' class='c014'><sup>[91]</sup></a> Although other elements
entered into the problem, it may be noted that the
efforts to colonize, whether near home in Ireland, or far off in
the new world, had been failures when general business was
poor, and successful when it became good.<a id='r92'></a><a href='#f92' class='c014'><sup>[92]</sup></a> Neither in Ulster
nor in Munster, in Newfoundland, Virginia, nor Guiana, had
the individuals or their associates, who had obtained grants,
been able, as yet, to plant any permanent settlements.</p>

<p class='c001'>The time, nevertheless, was evidently growing ripe for accomplishment.
Apart from any political or religious motives,
America was as certain to be colonized in the early part of
the seventeenth century as it was to be discovered by Columbus,
or someone else, in the latter part of the fifteenth. After
the fall of Calais in 1557, England, though fearful of the
future, had turned her back definitely and forever upon continental
conquest and entanglements, and had embarked boldly
upon those waves which it was to become her pride to rule.<a id='r93'></a><a href='#f93' class='c014'><sup>[93]</sup></a>
With the seas safe for traffic, with a host of younger sons and
other men suffering from the economic conditions of the time,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>with the growing need in England of many commodities found
in the new world, with the great growth of capital seeking investment,
and with the trade of practically every other portion
of the earth already in the hands of corporate companies,
English merchants and adventurers could not fail to turn again,
with ampler resources and better methods, to the land where
they had already tried and failed. The Muscovy Company
controlled all trade with Russia, the Eastland that with the
Baltic, the Levant that with Venice and the East, while another
controlled the African west coast, and the East India
Company held from the Straits of Magellan around to Africa
again.<a id='r94'></a><a href='#f94' class='c014'><sup>[94]</sup></a> Although these companies, which were almost wholly
owned in London, aroused the jealousy of Plymouth, Southampton,
and the other provincial ports, which found themselves
limited to a little nearby continental and coasting trade, they
pointed the way to the corporate form and joint-stock undertakings
as the successful method of handling large business
enterprises, such as colonizing was now realized to be.</p>

<p class='c001'>This was clearly brought out by an unknown author, who,
probably toward the end of 1605, wrote the paper known as
“Reasons for raising a fund.”<a id='r95'></a><a href='#f95' class='c014'><sup>[95]</sup></a> The writer strongly advocated
the raising of a “publique stocke” for “the peopling and discovering
of such contries as maye be fownde most convenient
for the supplie of those defects which the Realme of England
most requireth.” It is likely that this paper, which was intended
for Parliament, had considerable influence in the granting
of the Virginia charter, and it is, therefore, interesting to note
that, at the very beginning of successful colonization, one of
the leading points in future English colonial policy was thus
touched upon. It is often lost to sight that practically the
sole value of her colonies to England all through the sixteenth,
seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries was the value of their
trade, and the most important part of that trade, during nearly
all of the period, was in supplying her with such materials as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>she lacked at home. In this respect, her West Indian colonies
became more important than her continental ones, though an
exaggerated emphasis has been laid upon the contemporary importance
of the latter, in part because they chanced to revolt,
whereas the island colonies did not.</p>

<p class='c001'>As one of the reasons for raising a public fund to assist in
colonizing, our unknown author went on to say that “private
purces are cowld compfortes to adventurers,” and pointed to
the “marvelous matters in traficque and navigacon” which the
Hollanders had accomplished, in few years, by a “maine backe
or stocke.” Whether the paper was written in order to obtain
the Virginia charter, it is impossible to say; but apparently it
was, and, in any case, that charter was issued on the 10th of
April, 1606. The great revolution in foreign trade, which had
been going on for the past two centuries, was now complete,
and the period of chartered companies, foreshadowed by the
formation, in the latter part of the sixteenth century, of the
few already noted, was well under way.<a id='r96'></a><a href='#f96' class='c014'><sup>[96]</sup></a> With the addition of
the East India Company, chartered in 1600, the existing English
companies covered practically all known parts of the world
except America; and during the next generation about the
only companies organized were for the new world—North and
South Virginia in 1606, Guiana, 1609, Newfoundland, 1610,
Northwest Passage, 1612, Bermuda, 1615, New England, 1620,
and Massachusetts, 1629.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was a very close connection between many of these
great companies. The East India, for example, was practically
an outgrowth of the Levant;<a id='r97'></a><a href='#f97' class='c014'><sup>[97]</sup></a> while of the two hundred
and three members of the Virginia Company, one hundred and
sixteen were members of the East India, and thirteen of the
Muscovy, ten were to become interested in the Newfoundland,
one hundred in the Northwest Passage, forty-six in the Bermuda,
and thirty-eight in the New England companies. Members
of the Virginia Company were also represented in the
African, Levant, Guiana, Guinea, Eastland, Providence, Irish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>Plantation, and other stock enterprises.<a id='r98'></a><a href='#f98' class='c014'><sup>[98]</sup></a> To the noblemen
and merchants thus brought into close working relations,
America was but one of the many irons which they had in the
fire, and by no means the most important. Their interest, as
that of their successors, was naturally in British trade as a
whole, and not in the success of any particular colony, much
less in its religious bickerings or political aspirations. From
the very beginning, the trade of the Empire was considered
paramount to that of any unit, even in England itself. At this
very time, King James, in pressing for the union with Scotland,
expressed what was later to become the established policy.
“It may be,” he said, “that a merchant or two of Bristow or
Yarmouth may have a hundred pounds lesse in his packe; but
if the Empire gaine and become the greater, it is no matter.”<a id='r99'></a><a href='#f99' class='c014'><sup>[99]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>These two points thus early made, namely, that the value of
colonies lay in their contributing to the empire products otherwise
obtainable only from foreigners, and that the interests of
the empire as a whole were paramount to those of any section,
were well understood by those at the head of colonizing enterprises,
and must have been understood also by the more intelligent
of the early planters themselves. These views naturally
would continue to be held by those who remained at the
centre of the empire in England; while those who dwelt on its
periphery, in many scattered settlements, would as naturally,
in time, tend to lose sight of them, and to consider their own
particular interests as greater than those of the empire. The
struggle between these centripetal and centrifugal forces was
bound to result in warping the imperial structure, though in
one case only was it to end in the breaking away of a part of
the system. Adjustments, continuing even to the present day,
were to save the rest intact; but it is interesting to note the
germs of conflict present from the very beginning. The forces
which brought that conflict about were operative, in varying
degrees, not only in North America, but throughout the entire
empire, and extended back to its unconscious inception.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>The charter granted in 1606 provided for the formation of
two colonizing companies, one of which was authorized to plant
anywhere on the American coast between latitudes 34° and
41° North, and the other between 38° and 45°, provided that,
should either, or both, choose to settle in the overlapping strip
of three degrees, they should not plant within one hundred
miles of each other.<a id='r100'></a><a href='#f100' class='c014'><sup>[100]</sup></a> The patentees of the first company
were residents of London, while those of the second were of
Plymouth, the companies thus becoming known as the London
and Plymouth companies respectively. Among the patentees
of the latter, which embraced New England, were Thomas
Hanham, Raleigh Gilbert and George Popham, although the
names of the two who are thought to have been the prime
movers in the whole enterprise, Chief Justice Popham and Sir
Ferdinando Gorges, do not appear. Practically all those connected
with it had seen service in the Spanish war, and many
had already been interested in attempts to colonize in America
and elsewhere. The charter, together with the instructions
issued by the King some months later,<a id='r101'></a><a href='#f101' class='c014'><sup>[101]</sup></a> reveals a mixed organization,
partly proprietary and partly royal. The patentees
were to provide the capital and colonists, and to have control
of the trade, which was to be carried on by means of “magazines,”
or joint stock; but the King, through the provision of a
royal council appointed by himself, retained in his own hands
the government of the entire province from 34° to 45°. Two
local councils, one for each company's territory, were appointed
by the royal council, with power to govern the affairs of each
colony under the king's instructions. Land could not be
granted to individuals by the patentees, but only by the king,
upon application in their behalf by the local council for the
colony in which it was located.<a id='r102'></a><a href='#f102' class='c014'><sup>[102]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Both companies at once took steps to plant their colonies, the
Plymouth being the first in the field, although to the London
Company was to accrue the earliest lasting success. The
latter's expedition, including in its members Bartholomew Gosnold,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>who had already been in New England, and Captain John
Smith, who later was to become a factor there, sailed from
London in three ships, on December 20, 1606. Arriving in
Virginia the following spring, they established themselves at
Jamestown, and so founded, what, in spite of many vicissitudes,
was to be the first permanent English settlement in
America.</p>

<p class='c001'>Meanwhile, the Plymouth Company, mainly by virtue of
the activity of Sir Ferdinando Gorges, who became indefatigable
in his colonizing ardor, and of Chief Justice Popham,
had also commenced operations. In 1600 had occurred
Gorges's unfortunate connection with the revolt of Essex,
which had blasted his character in the eyes of the Puritans, and
so served, perhaps, to embitter his future relations with Massachusetts.
He had been for some time reinstated as Governor
of Plymouth, when Weymouth returned from his voyage in
1605; and from him Gorges obtained possession of the three
natives whom the captain had kidnaped on the coast of
Maine. Having learned much from them of the nature of the
country and its inhabitants, he despatched a vessel under Captain
Henry Challons, in August, four months after the granting
of the charter, with strict instructions to take the northern
route to Cape Breton, and then to follow the coast southward
to the place the natives had described.<a id='r103'></a><a href='#f103' class='c014'><sup>[103]</sup></a> Challons disobeyed
the order, went southward by the West Indies, and was captured
by the Spaniards, some of the crew, with himself and the
two natives, being carried to Spain, and others, by accident, to
Bordeaux. The latter, after having filed claims with the
authorities of the port, and left a “Letter of a Turnye,” returned
to England, as did also, after some time and difficulty,
Challons himself.<a id='r104'></a><a href='#f104' class='c014'><sup>[104]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Although the little ship of fifty-five tons had carried only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>twenty-nine Englishmen, it had been the intention to leave
some of them for settling, “if any good occasion were offered”;
and the Chief Justice had also dispatched a ship, under Captain
Hanham, to meet and assist Challons in the enterprise.
This, of course, he was unable to do; but he explored the shore,
taking back with him to the company “the most exact discovery
of that coast that ever came into their hands.”<a id='r105'></a><a href='#f105' class='c014'><sup>[105]</sup></a> The
reports were considered so encouraging that a much more considerable
effort was next made by the adventurers.</p>

<p class='c001'>On May 31, 1607, two ships, the Gift of God and the Mary
and John, were dispatched from Plymouth under command of
Raleigh Gilbert and George Popham, a relative of Sir John.<a id='r106'></a><a href='#f106' class='c014'><sup>[106]</sup></a>
The vessels became separated on June 29, and did not meet
again until August 7, among the St. George's Islands, off the
coast of Maine.<a id='r107'></a><a href='#f107' class='c014'><sup>[107]</sup></a> Having reached the mouth of the Kennebec,
then called the Sagadahoc, the colonists explored the stream,
and finally chose for their place of settlement a point at its
mouth, on the high ground of the peninsula of Sabino.<a id='r108'></a><a href='#f108' class='c014'><sup>[108]</sup></a> They
landed on the 19th, when they had a sermon preached to them,
and listened to the reading of their patent and laws. The next
day they began the building of their fort, named St. George,
followed by the dwellings and storehouse and the first boat
built in America.</p>

<p class='c001'>Meanwhile, the Spaniards were by no means oblivious of
what was going on, both in North and South Virginia; and to
the zeal of the Spanish ambassador in London in keeping his
master posted as to the encroachments of the English upon his
territories, we owe the preservation of a drawing of the fort in
the infant colony, which he obtained from some one who had
been there.<a id='r109'></a><a href='#f109' class='c014'><sup>[109]</sup></a> From the first discussion of the Virginia charter,
Zuñiga had written frequently to the King, telling him of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>plans and doings of the English, and advising strong action to
prevent their settling. For some years, Spanish spies were
kept at Jamestown, who regularly sent home word of what was
going on, by means of renegade English sailors, while evidently
there was also a traitor at Sagadahoc, as even in the Royal
Council itself.<a id='r110'></a><a href='#f110' class='c014'><sup>[110]</sup></a> A vessel was once dispatched by Spain to
wipe out both the colonies; but the crew proved faint-hearted,
and no attack was made upon either, the King, moreover, having
some hope, apparently, that both would conveniently prove
failures of themselves.</p>

<p class='c001'>At first, however, all went well at Sagadahoc, and early in
October the Mary and John was sent home to carry word of
the colony.<a id='r111'></a><a href='#f111' class='c014'><sup>[111]</sup></a> The account brought back so pleased Gorges that
he wrote a letter, “late at night,” to Sir Robert Cecil, to tell
him of the “greate newes.” But he was doomed to disappointment.
A couple of days later he had evidently heard
more, and in a second letter wrote that the settlement was
getting into trouble because of “childish factions, ignorant,
timerous and ambitious persons.” Popham, who had been
made president of the colony, he described as “an honest man,
but ould, and of an unwieldy body, and timerously fearfull to
offende, or contest with others that will or do oppose him, but
otherways a discreete, carefull man.” Gilbert was declared,
by hearsay, to be “desirous of supremacy, and rule, a loose life
prompte to sensuality, little zeale in Religion, humerouse,
headstronge and of small judgment and experience, other
wayes valiant inough.”<a id='r112'></a><a href='#f112' class='c014'><sup>[112]</sup></a> The next ship brought a letter from
Popham to the King, but no better news for the company
than the first, in spite of the president's enthusiastic belief in
the presence of nutmegs, cinnamon, and “other products of
great importance,” in the imaginatively tropical climate of
Maine.<a id='r113'></a><a href='#f113' class='c014'><sup>[113]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>During the winter, which was unusually severe, the storehouse
was burned, with most of the provisions; and before the
arrival of the two supply ships sent out from England, Popham,
the leader of the colony, died. The ships carried yet more
serious news to the colonists in the death of the Chief Justice
in England, which proved “such a corrosive to all, as struck
them with despair of future remedy.”<a id='r114'></a><a href='#f114' class='c014'><sup>[114]</sup></a> A later ship brought
word of the death of Sir John, Gilbert's elder brother, which
necessitated that leader's returning to England to look after
his affairs. The colonists, in view of all these circumstances,
resolved to quit the place, and return with Gilbert; and so all
“former hopes were frozen to death,” and, by October, the
wilderness of Maine was abandoned by the English, as, five
years before, it had been by the French.<a id='r115'></a><a href='#f115' class='c014'><sup>[115]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The character of the colonists, and, more particularly, the
unusual sequence of accidents, were enough to account for the
failure of the attempt, without invoking, with Gorges, “the
mallice of the Divell” to explain it. The company at home
became thoroughly discouraged, and no further efforts were
made to plant a settlement, although Sir Francis Popham, son
of the late Chief Justice, continued to send over vessels for
some years for trade and fishing, and it is probable that no year
now passed without the temporary presence of Englishmen
upon the coast.<a id='r116'></a><a href='#f116' class='c014'><sup>[116]</sup></a> In connection with the obtaining of a new
charter by the South Virginia Company, in 1609, the adventurers
in the Northern Company were offered the opportunity
to join with the Londoners on favorable terms, and to form
with them “one common and patient purse,” an opportunity
of which some of them availed themselves.<a id='r117'></a><a href='#f117' class='c014'><sup>[117]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Although temporarily abandoned as a site for colonizing, the
coast of North Virginia was by no means deserted, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>events of the next few years there were of great importance to
the future history of the territory. Hudson, an Englishman
employed by the Dutch, coasted along its shores during the
famous voyage on which he explored the river which bears his
name;<a id='r118'></a><a href='#f118' class='c014'><sup>[118]</sup></a> and the following year, Argall and Somers, attempting
to sail from Jamestown to Bermuda, were blown out of their
course, and having made for the North Virginia coast, spent
some time along it, fishing for cod.<a id='r119'></a><a href='#f119' class='c014'><sup>[119]</sup></a> Upon Hudson's voyage
was based the Dutch claim to their portion of North America.
The validity of such a claim to the country immediately about
the Hudson would depend upon the interpretation of the two
difficult points in connection with titles noted at the beginning
of this chapter.<a id='r120'></a><a href='#f120' class='c014'><sup>[120]</sup></a> Any such claim extended by Holland to the
coasts of the present eastern New England, however, could
have no standing whatever, as French and English explorations
in that exact locality had been both prior in date and far more
thorough. The only real dispute there lay between the English
and French, which was soon to be decided in the main by
force. In fact, with three nations, to say nothing of Spain,
claiming the same territory, all basing their claims upon discovery
within a few miles of each other, even where explorations
did not actually overlap, the points raised were too fine,
in the then inchoate state of international law, to permit of any
other arbitrament.</p>

<p class='c001'>When, owing to the annulling of De Monts's patent, the
French colony at Port Royal had been temporarily abandoned
in 1607, de Poutrincourt, who still retained his rights, intended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>to return speedily, and to continue his settlement. Various
delays, however, kept him in France for three years, and it was
not until the spring of 1610 that he again set sail. The houses
and their contents, untouched by the friendly Indians, were
found intact, and life at the little colony, which had thus been
merely interrupted, was resumed. In the following year, a
certain Captain Plastrier, who had been fishing near the
Kennebec, complained to the Sieur de Biencourt, Poutrincourt's
son, that he had been attacked and robbed by English,
who claimed title to the coast.<a id='r121'></a><a href='#f121' class='c014'><sup>[121]</sup></a> These may have been Captain
Williams and his party, who were annually sent out by
Francis Popham, or Captains Harlow and Hobson, who were
on the coast, in 1611, on a voyage of discovery and Indian-kidnaping,
for the Earl of Southampton.<a id='r122'></a><a href='#f122' class='c014'><sup>[122]</sup></a> Thus obscurely,
off the New England coast, between a French fisherman and
English seamen, whose very names are unknown to us, began
that duel for empire between France and England, which was
to last a century and a half, and which was to decide the fate
of the vast continent of North America and the teeming
millions of India. Clive and Dupleix, Wolfe and Montcalm,
were the successors of these humble pioneers striving to assert
the claims of their rival nations to the empire of the world.</p>

<p class='c001'>The significance of the attack by the English was not lost
upon the young Biencourt, who “represented very earnestly”
to his people how important it was to “every good Frenchman”
to prevent this usurpation by the English of lands claimed by
France, and occupied by her citizens “who had taken real
possession ... three and four years before ever the English had
set forth”—which was quite true in so far as related to colonizing.
In August, Biencourt made a trip along the shore of
Maine, stopping at St. Croix Island, where Plastrier had decided
to spend the winter, and thence down to the Kennebec,
where he inspected the abandoned site of the Popham colony,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>and made a careful examination of the coast. At the island
of Matinicus, where the attack on Plastrier had taken place, he
found some Englishmen fishing; but although he was urged by
some of his party to burn their ships, he would not do so, as
they were peaceful civilians, and contented himself with erecting
a large cross with the arms of France.<a id='r123'></a><a href='#f123' class='c014'><sup>[123]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>A couple of years later, under the more aggressive régime of
Madame de Guercheville and the Jesuits, an extension of
French settlement toward the south was attempted by the
founding of a colony on Mt. Desert, which was named St.
Sauveur.<a id='r124'></a><a href='#f124' class='c014'><sup>[124]</sup></a> It was not, however, to remain undisturbed for
many weeks, for at a meeting of the Quarter Court of the
Virginia Company in London, in July, 1612, Captain Argall
had been commissioned to drive out foreign intruders from the
country claimed under English charters, and had sailed from
England for that purpose.<a id='r125'></a><a href='#f125' class='c014'><sup>[125]</sup></a> After wintering in Virginia, he
proceeded northward the following summer, to clear the
territory as far as 45°, and promptly ran across the newly established
Jesuits on the Maine coast, being guided to them by
Indians, who were under the mistaken impression that the
English were friends.<a id='r126'></a><a href='#f126' class='c014'><sup>[126]</sup></a> The French, being taken wholly unaware,
made practically no resistance, the only one among
their number who had presence of mind enough even to fire
their cannon, having forgotten to aim it. Argall easily overcame
such opposition, and having obtained possession of La
Saussaye's commission from the French King, proceeded to
break up the colony and dispose of his prisoners.<a id='r127'></a><a href='#f127' class='c014'><sup>[127]</sup></a> Fifteen of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>them, including Biard and another of the Jesuit fathers, were
taken back as captives to Virginia, and the remaining thirty,
in two small boats, allowed to take their perilous way to rejoin
their countrymen to the northward.</p>

<p class='c001'>Soon afterward, Argall, with three ships and the Jesuit Biard,
who, apparently out of personal rancor toward Biencourt, had
turned traitor to his former associates, again set sail from
Virginia, for the purpose of completely extirpating the French
settlements. Revisiting St. Sauveur, he burned the buildings,
and tearing down the French cross, erected another. Continuing
his voyage, he put in at St. Croix, where he likewise
burned the buildings and confiscated the stores collected there.<a id='r128'></a><a href='#f128' class='c014'><sup>[128]</sup></a>
Arriving next at Port Royal, from which the inhabitants were
temporarily absent, a few miles off, after taking as booty even
the locks and nails from the buildings, as well as the food,
ammunition, and clothes of the unfortunate French, he burned
the whole settlement to ashes.<a id='r129'></a><a href='#f129' class='c014'><sup>[129]</sup></a> It is difficult to conceive of a
more dastardly act than thus to rob a peaceful colony of its
stores, and then to render it homeless on the approach of
winter in a far northern country.</p>

<p class='c001'>The action, however, if not the manner of it, fitted in with the
English temper of the time, which was becoming increasingly
aggressive in colonial matters. On the shores of India, as on
those of North Virginia, the cannon's mouth was announcing
territorial decisions of vast import for the future. Almost
simultaneously with the operations of Argall in Maine, Captain
Best, off the Indian coast, was having a running fight,
lasting a month, with four Portuguese ships, attended by over
a score of galleys, against his own little fleet of only two vessels.
As a result of his brilliant victory against these overwhelming
odds, the English obtained their first permanent foothold in
continental India.<a id='r130'></a><a href='#f130' class='c014'><sup>[130]</sup></a> The glorious battle of Swally, and the
petty raiding of Mt. Desert and Port Royal, were alike mere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>incidents in the struggle of new forces let loose by the age of
discovery, and the transformation of the European nations
into world powers. The struggles between French and English
in North Virginia and India; between English and Portuguese
in the Gulf of Cambay; between Dutch and Spanish,
or Dutch and Portuguese on many seas; between English and
Dutch in Guiana and on the Amazon and in the Spice Islands
of the East, must all be considered as but parts of one stupendous
drama. Everywhere along the edge of the world, traders
and settlers were being tossed on those stormy political waters,
where met the new tides of imperial ambition, fast flowing to
the farthest confines of the new-found seas.</p>

<p class='c001'>In that portion of the drama with which we are particularly
concerned, a new figure now appears upon the scene, whose
services to North Virginia have been somewhat overrated by
many, but whose personality remains a matter of fascinating
interest. Around few names in American history has legend
clustered more luxuriantly than around that of the South
Virginian hero Captain John Smith; and as to the real merits
of few men is opinion more diverse. Even though it must be
frankly admitted that no one will ever again think as highly
of the Captain as he thought of himself, yet much of the modern
detraction from his character and services is so evidently
biased as to be critically of little value. The main importance
of his share in North Virginian colonization, unlike his labors
in the south, was in his capacity as author, and his efforts to
stimulate interest in the possibilities of the New World. He
himself, however, wished for and endeavored to achieve a
more active part in the settlement of the country to which he
attached its present name of New England.</p>

<p class='c001'>He first saw its shores, on his only voyage thither, off the
island of Monhegan, in the spring of 1614, having been sent
out by some London merchants “to take Whales and make
tryalls of a Myne of Gold and Copper.”<a id='r131'></a><a href='#f131' class='c014'><sup>[131]</sup></a> If those failed, he
wrote, “Fish and Furres was then our refuge.” It was soon
evident that the refuge was needed, and it proved, fortunately,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>to be a goodly one, although along the New Hampshire and
Massachusetts coasts, he found that the French had recently
preceded him, and spoiled his market. While fishing for cod,
and trading with the Indians, he also explored a considerable
part of the shore, and, as a result of his observations, prepared
a map, on which many of the names still familiar to us appear
for the first time.<a id='r132'></a><a href='#f132' class='c014'><sup>[132]</sup></a> In spite of all the explorers who had preceded
him, Smith asserted that the shore was “still but even as
a coast unknowne and undiscovered”; and historians formerly
dated the beginning of modern New England cartography from
the appearance of his chart. Without necessarily detracting
from the excellence of Smith's field-work, however, his claim
to be the first accurate cartographer of our coast has been dispelled
by the discovery of the excellent map transmitted by the
Spanish ambassador in London to King Philip in 1611, and
found some years ago in the Archives at Simancas.<a id='r133'></a><a href='#f133' class='c014'><sup>[133]</sup></a> This map,
prepared for King James in 1610, shows that the New England
coast was well known, and had been well drawn, before ever
John Smith began his labors. It probably embodies the surveys
made by Gosnold, Archer, Pring, Weymouth, Champlain,
and, perhaps, others, and shows, for the first time, correctly
drawn, such characteristic features as the peculiar hook of Cape
Cod. This very point had hitherto been considered the distinguishing
mark of excellence of Smith's map, drawn six years
later.</p>

<p class='c001'>However, if Smith's cartographical services cannot now be
considered as important as formerly, his work as a popularizer
remains unimpaired. Although the map of 1610, until published
within the present generation, continued in the form of
a single manuscript copy, and was seen in its day by few outside
the inner circles of company promotion, Smith's was published
in a large edition, and, together with his <cite>Description</cite>,
which has not yet lost its charm, did much to spread a knowledge
of New England among the people. Many a man in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>disgrace with fortune must have pondered his note for those
“that have great spirits, and small meanes,” and have read
enviously of “the planters pleasures, and profits,” as set forth
by the plausible captain.</p>

<p class='c001'>An act of cruelty, which occurred on Smith's voyage, was to
bear unforeseen results in the future. One of the captains, a
rascal named Hunt, kidnaped twenty-four savages, and sold
them in Spain for slaves. One of these, who was subsequently
returned to his native land, was the Squanto who so materially
assisted the Pilgrims at Plymouth, as we shall see later.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of more immediate influence were the fish and furs with
which Smith reached London,—valued at £1500,—and which
served to direct attention to the possibilities of the region. It
was, it is true, a trifle compared with the £90,000 or more which
the stockholders of the East India Company were receiving
from the annual voyages of their fleet; but interest in colonizing
as well as in trading was rapidly growing.<a id='r134'></a><a href='#f134' class='c014'><sup>[134]</sup></a> In Ireland,
where colonization ran a course curiously analogous to that in
America, settlement now proceeded rapidly.<a id='r135'></a><a href='#f135' class='c014'><sup>[135]</sup></a> In Newfoundland,
two colonies were founded, and in Bermuda people were
said to be beginning “to nestle and plant very handsomely.”<a id='r136'></a><a href='#f136' class='c014'><sup>[136]</sup></a>
Little Englanders of an early type, and opponents of chartered
privilege, were not wanting, indeed, to inveigh against the
growing imperialism of the times. As “for the Bermudas, we
know not yet what they will do; and for Virginia, we know not
well what to do with it,” wrote one author; while Bacon compared
the visionary possibilities of America with the solid
results in Ireland.<a id='r137'></a><a href='#f137' class='c014'><sup>[137]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>While Smith had been ranging our coast, getting information,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>furs, and fish, another expedition, despatched by Gorges,
under Captain Hobson, was seeking gold on Martha's Vineyard.
Needless to say, he did not find it, and, as Smith
laconically remarks, he “spent his victuall and returned with
nothing.”<a id='r138'></a><a href='#f138' class='c014'><sup>[138]</sup></a> The tangible cash results of Smith's own voyage
pointed to him as the man whom the company needed, and by
them he was made Admiral of New England for life, and
started on another voyage, with two ships and Captain Thomas
Dermer. He never again, however, saw America. Owing to
damages to his vessel, received in a storm only a few days
out, he was forced to return to Plymouth; and although Dermer
went on, we know nothing of his trip.<a id='r139'></a><a href='#f139' class='c014'><sup>[139]</sup></a> On Smith's next
attempt, he was taken prisoner by pirates; and on his fourth
start, in 1617, for some reason he never got out of Plymouth
harbor.</p>

<p class='c001'>Voyages to New England now became frequent, however,
and it is not necessary to mention them all. In 1615, Sir
Richard Hawkins was exploring and trading for Gorges, whose
agent, Richard Vines, probably spent the following winter in
Maine, bringing back with him the first news of the great
plague which was decimating the Indians, and which was to
simplify the question of settlement. As Gorges speaks of
the “extreme rates” at which he had to hire men to stay the
winter quarter, it is probable that he had other parties there,
in this or other winters. “This course I held some years
together,” he wrote in his old age, “but nothing to my private
profit; for what I got one way I spent another; so that I
began to grow weary of that business, as not for my turn
till better times.”<a id='r140'></a><a href='#f140' class='c014'><sup>[140]</sup></a> The surprising part is, not that he grew
weary, but that he still continued the unprofitable business for
a lifetime.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1618, he received a letter from Captain Dermer, in Newfoundland,
saying that he had there found Squanto, one of
Gorges's savages, and that the Indian's description of New
England had made him desirous to “follow his hopes that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>way.”<a id='r141'></a><a href='#f141' class='c014'><sup>[141]</sup></a> The next spring, therefore, the indefatigable Gorges
sent out Captain Rocroft to meet Dermer and coöperate with
him. Dermer, meanwhile, had returned to England; so Rocroft
failed to meet him, and after capturing a French barque
off the New England coast, sailed to Virginia, contrary to
orders, and was there killed in a quarrel. Gorges reimbursed the
Frenchmen for the damages suffered, and, in other respects, made
a heavy loss on the voyage, from which he recovered nothing.</p>

<p class='c001'>As soon as possible after Dermer's unexpected arrival in
England, he was again fitted out and sent to join Rocroft, who
had meanwhile gone to Virginia. Having missed his associate
in the enterprise, whom he had expected to find at Monhegan,
Dermer sailed along the coast, making observations, from
Sagadahoc to Martha's Vineyard, and then on to Virginia.
Finding Rocroft dead, he wintered there, and went back to
New England in the spring.<a id='r142'></a><a href='#f142' class='c014'><sup>[142]</sup></a> Apparently on this visit, he returned
Squanto to his native Plymouth, where Dermer seems
to have wished to plant. “I would,” he wrote, “that the first
plantation might hear be seated, if ther come to the number of
50 persons, or upward”—a desire which was to be fulfilled
within a few months by the coming of the Pilgrims.</p>

<p class='c001'>Meanwhile, the colony in South Virginia, at Jamestown, had
been passing through a long series of troubles, which on more
than one occasion had nearly ended its career. Those in its
first years led the company to publish <cite>A True and Sincere Declaration</cite>
as to the affairs of the settlement, in which the form of
government was given as one of the roots of the evils which had
“shaken so tender a body.”<a id='r143'></a><a href='#f143' class='c014'><sup>[143]</sup></a> As a result of changes effected
by the two subsequent charters, which they obtained in 1609
and 1612, the London patentees were incorporated as a joint-stock
body, and their territory increased to a strip four hundred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>miles wide, extending from coast to coast, which they were empowered
to grant to others.<a id='r144'></a><a href='#f144' class='c014'><sup>[144]</sup></a> The old Royal Council was replaced
by one elected by the members of the company, thus
becoming subject, not to the king, but to the fifty-six city
companies, and to the six hundred and fifty-nine individuals,
who formed the membership of the enterprise at the time of
the 1612 charter. Governmental powers were also bestowed
upon it, and the colony thus became a proprietary province,
with a trading company as proprietor.<a id='r145'></a><a href='#f145' class='c014'><sup>[145]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The unfortunate results of the recent voyages in which
Gorges had been interested, so far from dampening his ardor,
had made him more anxious than ever to go on with his efforts.
The governmental changes in the charter for South Virginia,
together, perhaps, with the enlargement of its bounds, moved
him to apply for a new charter for the northern plantation.<a id='r146'></a><a href='#f146' class='c014'><sup>[146]</sup></a> A
dispute in which he had become involved with the southern
company, regarding its rights to fish within the limits assigned
to the North Virginia patentees, which rights he denied, had
won for him the hostility of a part of the Virginia Company's
membership. As the new charter for which he had applied
contained a clause giving the New England Company a monopoly
of the fishing along their entire section of the coast, it was
bitterly attacked by the southerners, who had annually gone
to the northern fishing-grounds for an important part of their
year's supplies. The dispute was taken into Parliament,
where Gorges defended himself with ability, and thence to the
King. The factional fight then in progress between Smythe
and Sandys, in the Virginia Company, led Smythe's party to
support Gorges against their opponents in their own company;
and as Gorges had also strengthened his cause by including
among his associates many of the influential nobles of the court,
an order in council was finally issued in his favor, on the 18th
of June, 1621, for the delivery of the new charter.<a id='r147'></a><a href='#f147' class='c014'><sup>[147]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Thus was originated the “Council established at Plymouth
in the County of Devon for the Planting, Ruling, and Governing
of New England in America,” which now became the proprietor
of all the territory between 40° and 48° North Latitude,
and extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific, in utter disregard
of the French claims in Nova Scotia and Canada, and
of the colonies planted there. The charter stated that there
were no subjects of any foreign power in possession of any part
of the territory, although Quebec had been settled for thirteen
years, and French fishermen and fur traders were constantly
being met by the English.<a id='r148'></a><a href='#f148' class='c014'><sup>[148]</sup></a> Upon the new company were
bestowed rights of trading, colonizing, and governing. The
members were allowed to elect their own officials in England,
and to appoint those for ruling in the settlements. The
members of the Virginia Company numbered nearly a thousand
persons, who elected their council, and were responsible for
the administration of the colony; but under the Gorges charter,
the council was the whole company, limited to forty members,
who were self-perpetuating, and whose relation to the colonists
was thus direct and final.<a id='r149'></a><a href='#f149' class='c014'><sup>[149]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The new company was never either active or successful.
The controversy which had marked its slow birth tended to
keep people from investing; and from its narrow and monopolistic
nature, it could make no appeal to popular support.
While the passage of the charter was still pending, chance
decreed that under it was to be made, even before its issue, the
first successful planting within its granted limits, and without
efforts of their own, the grantees, when they received the
powers bestowed upon them by the King, were to find the
Pilgrim colony already established at Plymouth.</p>

had no part whatever, they had recently been preceded to within a reasonable distance
of both the mouth and the source of the Hudson. The English had made a detailed
discovery as far as the entrance of the Sound, while Champlain was within a few miles
of the source of the river some months before the Dutch ascended it. If rights of
discovery were to be limited only to the points actually visited, with no extension
thence in any direction, the country would have become a veritable checker-board of
warring nationalities. The Dutch themselves held no such view, and claimed all the
land from Cape Cod to Delaware Bay, with indefinite limits toward the interior.
Acknowledgment of any such claim would have to be based upon a theory of extension
which would seem, therefore, equally to validate the claims of English and French,
arising in both cases from discovery prior to the Dutch.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER IV<br> <br> SOME ASPECTS OF PURITANISM</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The history of the New England group of colonies was,
in the main, shaped throughout the entire prerevolutionary
period by the influence of three factors. These were the geographical
environment, the Puritan movement in England, and
the Mercantile Theory. The first of these has already been
discussed, and the last will be more particularly referred to
later. As the second was not only a continuing influence during
the period, but was the chief determinant in the small settlement
of Plymouth, and an element in the great migration
to Massachusetts, it must be considered before entering upon
the story of those two colonies.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first difficulty in dealing with the problem of Puritanism
is to define the term itself. The earliest appearance of the
name seems to have been about 1566, and in the following year
a certain London congregation was spoken of as “Puritans or
Unspottyd Lambs of the Lord.” The members of this congregation,
which met secretly in Plumbers Hall, called their sect
“the pure or stainless religion”; and the derivation of the
name Puritan, for long a term of reproach, is sufficiently obvious.<a id='r150'></a><a href='#f150' class='c014'><sup>[150]</sup></a>
Its application, however, is less so. Part of the confusion
is due to the fact that, like “democratic” and many
other such words, it has been applied to an attitude toward
life, to a broad movement, and to a definite political party.
Moreover, between the meeting of those “Unspottyd Lambs”
in Plumbers Hall in 1567, and the overthrow of the Puritan
Commonwealth of England in 1660, nearly a century elapsed,
during which the meaning of the word underwent the changes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>which time always brings to words of its class, whereas it still
continues as a living term in our social and religious vocabulary.
Rigidly and briefly to define a word which has thus
had a vague and changing content throughout a dozen generations
is impossible. To attempt to confine its definition
to only one of its former meanings is unhistorical, however
desirable it may be that an author should define it as used
by himself in his own writings. Not long ago it was fashionable
to decry, as showing total lack of scholarship, any attempt
to apply the name to the men who founded Plymouth, it being
considered as applying solely to those who founded Massachusetts.
It may be true that “the Separatists were not
Puritans in the original sense of the word”;<a id='r151'></a><a href='#f151' class='c014'><sup>[151]</sup></a> but the word
did not retain its original sense, and although Separatist and
Nonconformist represent a real difference, the word Puritan
may well be used to cover both. The pendulum, indeed, seems
now to be swinging the other way, and several writers describe
Puritanism broadly as an “attitude of mind,” or as “idealism
applied to the solution of contemporary problems.”<a id='r152'></a><a href='#f152' class='c014'><sup>[152]</sup></a> As
specific terms for the many sects and minor currents in the
great movement, which for a time dominated the history of
both the Englands, are by no means lacking, it would seem
desirable to retain the use of the word Puritanism in its widest
application, and it is so used in the present work.</p>

<p class='c001'>The idea of unity seems to possess a peculiar fascination for
the average human mind. Only a savage or a philosopher may
be content with, or rise to, the conception of a pluralistic universe.
Moreover, the desire to conform, and to force others to
do so, is as typical of the average man as of the average boy.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is in but few persons, and in rare periods, that the spirit of
unrest, of dissatisfaction, of growth, manifests itself so strongly
as to overcome the innate tendency toward static conformity.
The mediæval period was essentially, for the most part, one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>religious unity. For long, the two great ideas of the Empire
and the Church had dominated men's minds. With the Renaissance
and the Reformation, however, arose again, not only
nationalities, but individualities. With the growth of the
separate nations, developed simultaneously a new sense of individual
responsibility in the face of the universe. For the
average man during the Middle Ages, the moral, even more
than the economic, life had been corporate. Outward conformity
to the dogmas and usages of the only church which then
represented Christ's Kingdom upon earth lulled his thoughts,
and soothed his conscience. The necessity of belonging to
the Church was not forced upon a man merely by fear of persecution
or of the public opinion of his own little world. His
belief in such a relation, and his ignoring the possibility of any
other, had become as innate and instinctive as his belief in the
physical laws of the universe by which he guided his daily life.
It was not alone the historians of the period who were “content
to be deceived, to live in a twilight of fiction,” as “the
atmosphere of accredited mendacity thickened.”<a id='r153'></a><a href='#f153' class='c014'><sup>[153]</sup></a> The subtle
poison had flowed through the veins of the entire social
organism.</p>

<p class='c001'>As the idea of nationality grew and rooted itself in the mind
of the masses, it attracted to itself, by a sort of mental gravitation,
the institutions and thoughts of the peoples. Everywhere,
the religious reformation had been closely allied with
secular politics, and the reformed churches became national.
As universal empire had gradually given place to nations, so
the universal church was in part broken into state churches, but
without any loosening of the bond which bound the individual
to them. The idea of <em>the</em> church persisted, and the average
man considered separating himself from it almost as one would
consider separating one's self from the civil state of to-day. It
was almost as unthinkable and impossible to realize in practice.
His life was so interwoven with it, his civil rights, as
well as his religious duties, were so involved in his relations to
it, that, even if he disagreed with its dogma, disliked its policy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>or strove within it to alter both, he had no thought of leaving
it. To do so would have been to constitute himself a religious
anarch. Not only were the mental inhibitions to the development
of such an idea greater than those operating in the case
of political anarchy to-day, but the pains and penalties attending
the action, both from law and from public opinion, were
also greater.<a id='r154'></a><a href='#f154' class='c014'><sup>[154]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>One of the most dynamic ideas, however, which had come in
with the Reformation, was that of the responsibility of the individual
to God, both for his own life and for that of others.
To those whose minds were open to receive it, the thought
came with a force which was almost overwhelming. In the
training of youth, it is well recognized that responsibility must
be thrown upon them gradually if their characters are to grow
normally, and not be warped or broken under sudden strain.
But here were men, in many cases incredibly ignorant of the
Christian story, to whom the very existence of such a book as
the Bible had been unknown, and whose faith and conduct
had been regulated for them for centuries. Suddenly they
found themselves in possession of the original sources in their
own tongues, and were told that the eternal salvation of their
souls was no longer in the keeping of the institution upon which
they had always leaned with the unconscious confidence of a
child upon its parents. Inspired by a new sense of their importance
as individuals, and, in the majority of cases, by a
self-confidence born of ignorance, earnest men undertook to
interpret the scriptures, and to revise the existing ritual,
dogma, and government of the Church. Extreme individualism
on all these points was the natural result. Sects, often
counting only single congregations in their numbers, arose
everywhere. Separatism was the logical end of these discontents
and strivings; but men are not logical in their actions,
and separatism formed but a small element in the Puritan
movement. Where it did occur, the disintegrating force did
not usually stop there, but continued to plague, with petty and
ignoble quarrels, the little groups thus split off.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Not only were the Separatists logical, but their action required
far more courage than that of the mere Nonconforming
Puritans. Not only did the act itself call for a higher degree
of intellectual daring, but the penalties attached to it
were greater. In many cases, Nonconformity, so far from entailing
loss or suffering, possessed a distinct money and social
value; but no highly paid cure or easy berth in the household
of a Puritan nobleman awaited the Separatist. Misguided as
many of the latter may have been, and disappointing as were
many of the Separatist movements, it would seem that, on the
whole, the Separatists possessed more sincerity and loyalty
to their ideas than the Puritans who remained within the
Church. This the great majority of them did. The number
of Separatists, like the number of Puritans generally, has
usually been overstated in the past. The twenty thousand
Brownists mentioned by Raleigh in 1593 have dwindled, under
the light of modern critical research, to a mere five or six
hundred at most.<a id='r155'></a><a href='#f155' class='c014'><sup>[155]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>When the ordinary man gets a new idea, it does not necessarily
dislodge the old ones that may be antagonistic to it, or
even greatly modify them.<a id='r156'></a><a href='#f156' class='c014'><sup>[156]</sup></a> The tendency to cling to the established
church was as strong in the minds of most Puritans
as was their self-confidence in their own beliefs and superior
sanctity, and their desire to alter the Church to suit them,
whether in the earlier demands in the matter of vestments, or
the later in matters of polity and doctrine. Thus the survival
of the mediæval idea of the Church, coupled with the new one
of individual judgment and responsibility, led the conservative
Puritans to adopt a half-way policy as compared with the
Churchmen and the Separatists.</p>

<p class='c001'>Under Henry VIII there had been little change, save in the
single fact of the break with Rome, and the substitution of
King for Pope as the head of the Church. The ecclesiastical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>property had, indeed, been largely confiscated and distributed
among the laity so as to create a powerful economic interest
in the maintenance of the King's supremacy. By the fact of
that supremacy, religious questions had become political, and
important changes would necessarily in time have to be made
in church administration and discipline. Otherwise, however,
there was little alteration, and apparently but two out of the
King's subjects refused to conform to the new order.<a id='r157'></a><a href='#f157' class='c014'><sup>[157]</sup></a> Although
further progress was made under Edward, the reign of
Mary restored the union with Rome, and sent many exiles to
Frankfort, Geneva, and other centres of the Protestant movement
on the continent.<a id='r158'></a><a href='#f158' class='c014'><sup>[158]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>On the accession of Elizabeth, the refugees flocked back to
London, keen to work into the fabric of the English church
the religious ideas which they had imbibed and developed
during their exile. The bulk of the clergy, however, were not
desirous of innovation, and seem hardly to have been affected
by the controversies raging at the time.<a id='r159'></a><a href='#f159' class='c014'><sup>[159]</sup></a> Of the nine thousand
four hundred serving the Church under the Pope in Mary's
reign, fewer than one hundred and eighty, or less than two per
cent, refused the Oath of Supremacy under Elizabeth.<a id='r160'></a><a href='#f160' class='c014'><sup>[160]</sup></a> Not only
had the parish priests thus accepted with indifference the
various changes,<a id='r161'></a><a href='#f161' class='c014'><sup>[161]</sup></a> but the laity in the country districts, especially
in the north, had scarcely been touched by the Reformation.
When Elizabeth came to the throne, the distracted
country needed, above all else, peace and unity. The fifth of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>her house to reign in the period of about seventy-five years
since the end of the long War of the Roses, she found a nation
yet suffering from the severe economic effects of that protracted
crisis, and a church rendered unstable in doctrine and
almost impotent in discipline by the four alternations between
Roman and Protestant allegiance which had occurred in less
than a quarter of a century. The question of her own legitimacy,
bound up as it was with the question of religious authority,
and the extreme delicacy of international political relations,
especially with Spain, France, and Scotland, added difficulties
to the problem of church settlement.<a id='r162'></a><a href='#f162' class='c014'><sup>[162]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>An established church was a necessity from all three standpoints,
of religion, morals, and politics. Here and there, a few
zealots might organize their own congregations and support a
preacher; but any sort of congregational church government
was out of the question for the overwhelming mass of the
people, who were ignorant and indifferent, but still superstitiously
devoted to the old Roman forms. The moral sanctions
of the time were, moreover, far more closely involved with religion
than they are to-day, and the church was far more
essential as a prop to a government none too strong. The situation
called for the opportunist policy which the Queen always
favored in every difficulty. Whatever may have been her
own religious beliefs or lack of them, which cannot now be
known, she never cared for religious persecution, but she cared
everything for a strong and united England. Although conformity
was necessary to prevent the disintegration of the
national life, the standards to which she required men to conform
were purposely left so vague as to permit all but the
most advanced of Protestant sectaries and most irreconcilable
of Romanists to become members of the Church of England.</p>

<p class='c001'>Opportunism may temporarily save a dangerous situation,
but cannot be pursued successfully as a permanent policy.
The course of events led extreme Catholics to feel that the
Church had advanced so far that they could not follow it, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>the ultra-Puritans to consider that it had stopped so short
that they could not stay for it. To an opposition, all things,
theoretically, seem possible. The practical difficulties are
for those who have the responsibility of power. By the end
of Elizabeth's reign, the Catholics realized that the most
they could hope for would be toleration; and the real struggle
for the control of the organization lay between the Puritans
and those who wished the Church to continue its middle course.
It must be pointed out, that this struggle of the Puritan Nonconformists
was in no sense for toleration. They had as little
thought of it as the Inquisition itself, nor did they exercise it
when in power, either in old or New England. In that regard,
the Separatist John Robinson, preaching to his little congregation
in Leyden, was as far ahead of the Puritan leaders in England,
as Roger Williams was of the leaders of Massachusetts.</p>

<p class='c001'>As has already been seen, only two men failed to conform to
the change under Henry in 1534, and less than two per cent
were forced from their cures when Elizabeth introduced the
Oath of Supremacy. In the great deprivations under James
and Archbishop Bancroft, following the adoption of the Canons
of 1604, the most careful sifting of all the records indicates
that less than three hundred Puritan clergy were deprived of
their livings.<a id='r163'></a><a href='#f163' class='c014'><sup>[163]</sup></a> On the other hand, when the Puritans came
into power, out of eighty-six hundred clergy of the Church, the
livings of approximately thirty-five hundred, or over forty per
cent, were sequestrated.<a id='r164'></a><a href='#f164' class='c014'><sup>[164]</sup></a> The Nonconformist struggle was not
for toleration, but for control. Indeed, the objection of the
Puritans to the Court of High Commission itself, to which
they sometimes voluntarily carried their own cases, and which
had a certain popularity that has largely been lost to sight,
was not so much that it was an instrument of oppression, as
that at times it was turned against themselves.<a id='r165'></a><a href='#f165' class='c014'><sup>[165]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>One of the claims made for them is that they constituted a
large percentage of both the clergy and the laity, and embraced
a great part of the learned men of the church, and were therefore
entitled to guide the organization. This claim does not
stand the test of rigid criticism. As exhaustive a list as possible,
giving every doubtful name to the Puritans, shows not over
three hundred Puritan clergy in the church between 1600 and
1610, or about three per cent of the establishment.<a id='r166'></a><a href='#f166' class='c014'><sup>[166]</sup></a> There
are no figures available for the laity, but computations based
on various methods of estimating the numbers yield totals
equivalent to from two to six per cent of the population. These
figures may be too low, but it must be considered that the
common people, particularly in the country districts, were
inert to a much greater degree even than to-day, and their normal
attitude toward the clergy might well have been summed
up in the dictum of the choir in Hardy's “Under the Greenwood
Tree,” that “there's virtue in a man's not putting a
parish to spiritual trouble.”</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, again, as tending unduly to swell the
estimated number of Puritans, it must be remembered that
the great landlords possessed the gift of many livings, and if
one of them, from any motive whatever, turned Puritan, all
of his livings could be bestowed upon Puritan clergy, and the
congregations would be nominally counted as Puritan. For
example, to cite by no means the most influential of a group
which included such men as the Earl of Warwick, we may note
that Sir Robert Jermyn controlled ten livings in one archdeaconry,
while nine other laymen controlled sixty-five more.<a id='r167'></a><a href='#f167' class='c014'><sup>[167]</sup></a>
Thus these ten men—chosen somewhat at random—owned
seventy-five livings; and, upon their declaring themselves
Puritans, not only would seventy-five clergy have to become
Puritans, to be acceptable, but, if we place their congregations
as low as two hundred each, we would have fifteen thousand
laity thus attending Puritan churches as a result of the religious
or other motives which had moved ten landlords to number
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>themselves with the Saints. This indicates how impossible it
is to calculate the number of Puritans who were such by sincere
conviction.</p>

<p class='c001'>As to the learning of the Puritan clergy, the latest researches
also fail to bear out the earlier controversial claims on their
behalf. Of the two hundred and eighty-one men whose names
are known, one hundred and seventy-six had no university
degree, while of the remainder, only thirty-one were higher
than Masters of Arts.<a id='r168'></a><a href='#f168' class='c014'><sup>[168]</sup></a> There were, indeed, Puritan divines
eminent for learning, but the proportion of university men
among them was no higher than is known to have been the case
among the Conformists.</p>

<p class='c001'>Hence the Puritans were but a small minority, both of the
clergy and of the laity. The instinct of fair play, which leads
a man to side with the under-dog, without stopping to consider
whether the upper-dog may be not only upper, but justified,
induces us to lay great stress on the rights of minorities, on
the theory that a majority can take care of itself. Minorities,
however, are usually vocal, organized, and zealous, while the
majority is dumb, unwieldy, and but little inclined constantly
to resist the attacks of all the various minorities in the field.
If there is reason to condemn the Church in England for
requiring the Puritan minority to conform, then the Puritans
themselves must be condemned just as strictly for their oppression
of the minorities in New England. There cannot be two
canons of judgment for the same act; and, in fact, as we shall
see later, the Puritans there in power were, if anything, the
more guilty of the two.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is much truth, however, in the doctrine of the saving
remnant; and, in the low condition of morals in the early
seventeenth century, it may well be that the Puritan element
was that remnant by which England was saved, as well as New
England founded. For morality had sunk to a low ebb, and,
even if the reality was not as black as it was painted by Puritan
writers, we know enough to realize that there was sore need of
a reforming zeal which should cleanse society of its rapidly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>accumulating filth. That zeal was provided almost wholly
by the Puritans. Not but that there were plenty of moral and
able men in the other party, who were striving with the problems
of the day as well as the Unspotted Lambs and Saints—striving,
perhaps, with better understanding and more breadth
of view. But that was not what the moral situation called
for. Luckily the more extreme of the Puritans were thoroughgoing
fanatics; for nothing less than a good dose of fanaticism
seemed likely to purge England of its social evils. But that is
a different matter from fanaticism erected into a permanent
compulsory system, or from the attempt to control an organization
by three per cent of its membership; and it must be
admitted that there was much to be said on the side of Archbishop
Bancroft and the Church. Not only was the small
number of the Puritans known to him, and also their methods,
which were by no means above reproach, but their refusal to
coöperate in an effort to reform one of the worst abuses confirmed
his belief that their real desire was not for reform but
to force their views on the other ninety-seven per cent of the
clergy and the nation, and to gain control of the ecclesiastical
machinery of the State Church.</p>

<p class='c001'>He was thoroughly familiar with the facts that modern research
has brought to light in regard to the methods of securing
signatures to the various petitions presented to the King, and
knew how much less they represented than they purported to.<a id='r169'></a><a href='#f169' class='c014'><sup>[169]</sup></a>
Very real abuses in the Church, which were undoubtedly largely
responsible for the low spiritual state of the people at large,
were those of pluralities, non-residence, and lack of properly
qualified preachers, although the number of clergy holding
more than one living has been exaggerated. To a very great
extent, the reason for the practice, as well as the cause of the
great number of inferior, and even immoral, men, who were to
be found in the Church, was economic. As we noted in an
earlier chapter, the period had been one of an unexampled rise
in prices, and in both the cost and scale of living. The tithes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>which supported the clergymen, had originally been paid in
kind, but had gradually been commuted into money payments
at a time when prices were low, and the general manner of
living far inferior to that of the later Elizabethan period. In
1585, over one half of all the clergy received salaries of less than
£10 each;<a id='r170'></a><a href='#f170' class='c014'><sup>[170]</sup></a> of these, approximately three thousand received
less than £5, and one thousand but £2 annually, or less.<a id='r171'></a><a href='#f171' class='c014'><sup>[171]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Pluralism and ignorant preachers were the only possible
spiritual fruits of such an economic system, though the use of
pluralities was abused by some of the higher clergy. Bills
were introduced in the Parliament of 1604 for the increase of
the incomes of the parish priests, thus striking at the root of
the trouble; but they were shelved by the Puritan Commons,
though the Puritans were loud in their denunciation of these
very evils.<a id='r172'></a><a href='#f172' class='c014'><sup>[172]</sup></a> By means of contributions, however, they increased
the pay of their own clergymen, so that a Puritan
incumbent might expect from two to three times what a Conformist
might be paid in a similar cure. At a time when over
half of the clergy were receiving less than £10, one Puritan of
the Dedham Classis received £50, several others from £30 to
£70, a Mr. Dalby £40, another £50, yet another £73, a Puritan
assistant £33, and one Puritan congregation which offered
over £46 had difficulty in finding any reformer who was
willing to accept so small an amount.<a id='r173'></a><a href='#f173' class='c014'><sup>[173]</sup></a> Here at any rate, was
a very tangible reward for those who felt that they could remain
in an institution which they condemned, while they drew
pay from both sides. Many a poor devil of a sincerely conforming
parish priest, struggling along on two or three pounds
a year, must have wondered whether it were not worldly-wise
to turn Puritan; and a Separatist had to console himself
with a logical position and a comfortable conscience.</p>

<p class='c001'>Advocates of the Puritans, in an effort to prove that their
minds were not absorbed by squabbles over petty details of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>vestments and symbols, have explained at length the importance
of such matters in that age; and they are quite right.
The Puritan attack, however, was not merely against the surplice,
or minister who did not preach, or immorality in private
life, as it certainly was not for liberty of conscience. It was
obvious to those in authority that what the reformers desired
was a change of the established church government into the
Presbyterian form, with themselves in control. Masson claims
that between 1580 and 1590 there were not less than five hundred
beneficed clergy who practically maintained a Presbyterian
organization within the body of the Church.<a id='r174'></a><a href='#f174' class='c014'><sup>[174]</sup></a> Although
these numbers may be somewhat too large, evidence was continually
cropping out which showed that the Puritans wished
not only to gain control of the Church, but to substitute the
Presbyterian discipline in its place.<a id='r175'></a><a href='#f175' class='c014'><sup>[175]</sup></a> Marsden, like many other
writers, has raised the questions whether the points at issue
were really vital, and whether more “Christian meekness and
moderation” should not have been shown “even to the obstinate.”<a id='r176'></a><a href='#f176' class='c014'><sup>[176]</sup></a>
From the standpoint of the administration of a great
organization, upon which rested the responsibility of maintaining
what it believed to be essential both to the Church and
to the State, it must be admitted that these things did seem
vital, just as they seemed so to the small Puritan minority. If
they were not vital, then we must impugn either the good faith
or the intellectual ability of the entire mass of Puritans who
fought for them so bitterly; and if they were, then it must be
conceded that they were quite as much so for the majority in
power as for the minority in opposition.</p>

<p class='c001'>The ecclesiastical struggle between the Nonconforming Puritans
and the Church, then, was fundamentally administrative.
It came down to the question whether a powerful organization,
which thoroughly believed in itself and its own importance, as
all powerful organizations and vested interests come to do,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>should allow itself to be turned out of control by a small minority,
whose attitude it considered detrimental, not only to itself,
but to religion and the State. There could be only one answer.
Had it not been for the survival of the mediæval idea as to the
necessity of belonging to the Church, it is possible that those
Puritans who were actuated purely by spiritual motives would
have followed the more consistent Separatists, and merely have
withdrawn from the body with whose government and usage
they were no longer in accord. In that case, the way would
have been cleared for the great moral influence which the
Puritans exerted, without the embittering results of the struggle,
and the reaction of 1660 against Puritanism as it showed
itself when in political power. On the other hand, political
liberty might have been the loser.</p>

<p class='c001'>In theological dogma, the Puritans had, at least until the
later period, but little quarrel with the Church. Both were
largely under the influence of Calvinistic doctrine, although
there was considerable latitude of belief among individuals of
both parties. The central pivot of their creed was the absolutely
unconditioned will of God.<a id='r177'></a><a href='#f177' class='c014'><sup>[177]</sup></a> The system, which is
strongly tinged with legal doctrine, acknowledges no law but
that of his untrammeled will. From this flow two consequences.
One is that there is no room for a non-moral sphere
of activity, for actions which, belonging merely to the domain
of nature, are untinged by moral obligation. The other is
the doctrine of predestination, by some considered the central
point of the Calvinistic theology. “God not only foresaw the
fall of the first man, and the ruin of his posterity in him,” wrote
Calvin, “but also arranged all by the determination of his
own will.”<a id='r178'></a><a href='#f178' class='c014'><sup>[178]</sup></a> The decree involved both election and reprobation.
Except for this decree, all human beings, including
those to whom the gospel had never been preached, and the
baby who died at his first breath, were condemned to hell forever.
God, however, chose certain individuals as his elect to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>be saved, foreordained from all eternity by “his gratuitous
mercy, totally irrespective of human merit.” The rest He
condemned eternally, by “a just and irreprehensible but incomprehensible
judgment.”<a id='r179'></a><a href='#f179' class='c014'><sup>[179]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Although this decree, being eternal and immutable, could
not be altered by anything that the individual could do, as
he was forever blessed or damned irrespective of his character
or conduct, yet, since the wills of those chosen as the elect
were in harmony with God's will, by careful observation of
one's own actions it might be possible to lift the veil and discover
whether one were, perhaps, of the elect or not. Hence
all those torturing self-examinations and searchings of heart,
which fill so much of the early Puritan letters and diaries.
Such doctrine, though apparently stripping God of every shred
of what we consider moral character, would be of profound
influence upon that of those who truly believed it; and the
Puritan believed with extraordinary tenacity. His imagination
was wholly concentrated on questions of religion, and that
religion was a “narrow Hebraism” which “kept open its windows
toward Jerusalem, but closed every other avenue to the
soul.”<a id='r180'></a><a href='#f180' class='c014'><sup>[180]</sup></a> His creed must not be considered as merely a series
of logical deductions from the Bible, which appealed to him
solely through the intellect. Heaven and hell were as vividly
visualized by him as external facts.<a id='r181'></a><a href='#f181' class='c014'><sup>[181]</sup></a> In the early seventeenth
century this doctrine was a living thing, the word-pictures
not having lost their reality by long familiarity and much
repetition.</p>

<p class='c001'>If it be asked how people who believed that no efforts that
they could make would save them from everlasting damnation,
if not of the elect, could possibly face life with any cheerfulness,
the answer is that the Puritans considered themselves
as elected. Now and then a poor wretch did torture himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>with the belief that he was damned, and occasional qualms
were experienced by the staunchest; but, on the whole, the
terrible doctrine seems to have lost its greatest sting for the
individual in the comfortable assurance that, although the
bulk of his neighbors were going to hell, he himself was one
of the everlasting Saints. Such belief naturally fostered, too,
that smugness of self-assurance that has always been characteristic
of Puritan reformers in all ages, and also a hard intolerance.
Those who did not believe as the Puritans believed were not
of the elect, and so were condemned by God to eternal torment.
No act of intolerance shown toward them by the Puritans
could thus compare with the almost unthinkable intolerance
displayed toward them by the author of their being. To show
toleration or mercy toward such was, logically, to exalt humanity
above the deity.</p>

<p class='c001'>To the Puritan, the reign of law was merely the reign of
God's will, but it was universal. No act was indifferent, either
in the universe or in the individual. John Winthrop's consideration
of the special providence of God, in permitting the
discovery of a spider in some porridge before it was eaten, was
not merely Puritanical.<a id='r182'></a><a href='#f182' class='c014'><sup>[182]</sup></a> It was scriptural, and it was to the
Scriptures that every Puritan turned to ascertain the will of
God upon every detail of daily life. This obviously opened
the way to the most far-reaching tyranny to which men could
be called upon to submit, should those fanatically holding the
view be in possession of the civil power to enforce it. The
tyranny of political despotism had left untouched the whole
vast field of private conduct, save in so far as the acts of individuals
might minister directly to the despot's pleasure,
wealth, or power. The conformity forced upon individuals by
established churches had left to the individual his whole freedom
outside of the limited relations to the establishment and
its doctrines. But the Puritan left no such free spaces in life.
Nothing was so small as to be indifferent. The cut of clothes,
the names he bore, the most ordinary social usages, could all
be regulated in accordance with the will of God. For him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>that will was expressed once for all, and only, in the Bible, and
of that Bible the Puritan believed that he alone had the key,
and was the valid interpreter for the rest of mankind. The
more extreme of the sects, indeed, occasionally remind one
of those hill tribes of the northern Himalayas, who consider
themselves so holy that no one is allowed to touch their persons,
while they alone are allowed to approach the symbol of their god.<a id='r183'></a><a href='#f183' class='c014'><sup>[183]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In a trial before the High Commission, in 1567, of certain
Puritans who had hired a hall ostensibly for a wedding, and
had then held an illegal prayer meeting in it, one of them
claimed that he should be tried only by the word of God.
“But,” said the dean, “who will you have to judge of the word
of God?”<a id='r184'></a><a href='#f184' class='c014'><sup>[184]</sup></a> The obvious answer, which every Puritan, from
then to now, has made, is that he alone is such an interpreter,
not merely for himself, but for the entire community. It
was natural, with the Puritans' idea of God, that they should
take special delight in the Old Testament. From it, almost
exclusively, they drew their texts, and it never failed to provide
them with justification for their most inhuman and bloodthirsty
acts. Christ did, indeed, occupy a place in their
theology, but in spirit they may almost be considered as Jews
and not Christians. Their God was the God of the Old Testament,
their laws were the laws of the Old Testament, their
guides to conduct were the characters of the Old Testament.
Their Sabbath was Jewish, not Christian. In New England,
in their religious persecutions and Indian wars, the sayings of
Christ never prevailed to stay their hands or to save the blood
of their victims.<a id='r185'></a><a href='#f185' class='c014'><sup>[185]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>From this attitude toward the Bible the doctrine developed,
as Milton wrote, that in that book God had once for all revealed
all true religion, “with strictest command to reject all other
traditions or additions whatsoever.”<a id='r186'></a><a href='#f186' class='c014'><sup>[186]</sup></a> It was upon this belief
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>that the Puritan took his stand in opposition to the Church.
For him, truth had been revealed once for all, in its entirety.
Nothing could be added, nothing could be taken away. To
this deadening doctrine, the Church opposed the idea of growth
and development. Combine this theory of the absolute
finality of the truth, as revealed in books written centuries
before, with the Puritan habit of literal interpretation, and the
verbal application of sayings, torn from their context, to every
occasion of domestic and public life, and we have, not merely
an engine of spiritual and moral despotism, but one which was
calculated to stultify all liberty of thought. Once allow the
body of men professing such doctrine to dominate public
opinion, or control the machinery of government, and there
would evidently be no limit to their deadly influence upon
freedom of intellect as well as of action. It is not a question
of the personal morality of its professors or of the nobility of
their motives. Without the vital idea of development, both
would slowly harden into mere forms and empty professions,
while the human mind would lie shackled, debarred from seeking
new truth, or from making those experiments which alone
bring about healthy growth. The attempt was made, both in
old England, with its ancient civilization, and in the New, untrammeled,
as far as is ever possible, by any vestige of the past.
It is one of the elements that give unique interest to the history
of New England as compared with that of the other colonies
on our coast. Had they all alike failed, no interest would
attach to the others, above that of scores of other attempts to
settle a wilderness. But in New England there was an effort,
under the most favorable conditions possible,—numbers, economic
resources, untrammeled freedom,—to found and govern
a state solely by the self-confessed elect of the community.</p>

<p class='c001'>Puritanism was essentially a movement of protest, and so was
largely negative. In fact, to such a degree was it a matter of
protest and negation, that the Puritan became absolutely fascinated
in his contemplation of that first great protestor and protagonist
of negation, the devil himself. It has frequently been
pointed out that, in the one great poem which the movement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>has given us, the “Paradise Lost” of Milton, the real hero is
Satan, and that it is upon him that the poet's interest centres.
The Puritan's relations with the Deity were not merely fatalistic,
but were expressed in the legal form of a covenant in
which God and the individual were the contracting parties.
Drama, or melodrama, was supplied only by the devil, who,
from that standpoint, may almost be said to have been the
saving grace of the Puritan doctrine. Men become eloquent
over what appeals to their interest; and it is noteworthy that
not only did the finest English Puritan poem centre about the
devil, but the finest American Puritan prose was to be devoted
to the horrors of hell, and that Jonathan Edwards was to find
the last touch to the felicity of Heaven in the saints' contemplation
of the tortures inflicted upon the damned by the Arch-fiend
in the depths below.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was, as we have said, natural sympathy that attracted
the Puritans to the Old Testament, that long protest against
paganism, with its “thou shalt nots.” The positive side of
the New Testament seems to have left them singularly cold.
Indeed, so little appeal did the words of even Christ himself
make, that, for once, they abandoned their literalism in the
quoting of texts, and doubted whether the use of the Lord's
Prayer should be permitted, as it savored too much of ritualism.
The Puritans' virtues were thus mainly negations. Their
ideals were based almost wholly upon mere avoidance of sin.
They sought complete surrender of will. Humanity, in their
eyes, was so utterly an evil thing, that only by an undeserved
act of the grace of God was it possible that even a few human
beings could possibly do anything pleasing in his sight.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is not an ideal which can permanently satisfy man's
whole nature or exert complete influence over him. It is a far
cry back to the Greek picture of the perfect life as the fullest
development of the entire man, body and soul. Whether
that may not properly be a Christian ideal also is not to be discussed
here, but it is toward some such ideal of self-expression
that the ordinary man strives. His history is that of the
fuller and fuller development of his dual nature, in all its varied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>aspects. Sometimes the emphasis is placed here, sometimes
there, but it is difficult to see what other subject can really be
the central theme of his earthly striving, and the history of it.
Education, economic struggles, law, government, liberty,
“emancipation from superstition and caste,” all must be
traced through their long careers, but none are ends in themselves.
They are but the beginnings of opportunity, of no
value save in so far as they secure for man the most balanced
development and most perfect self-expression of which his
nature is capable. To this natural desire, the Puritan opposed
the utter surrender of one's own will to the divine will as expressed
in minuteness of detail, applicable to every need, even
to the style of hats for a minister's wife, in the old Semitic
writings. At the time of the Puritan movement, there was
much rank growth in society. That growth needed a severe
pruning, and for that service the Puritan deserves all praise.
But the pruning-knife, after all, is only one of the garden implements,
and a tree is pruned that it may grow more abundantly.</p>

<p class='c001'>This system of negation and protest might have done its
needed work and passed, had it not had the misfortune, from the
moral and intellectual sides, to come to dominate the power of
government. At first Puritanism claimed nothing that could
really be termed a party. It may be compared to the Labrador
current, cold and invigorating, flowing through the ocean of
national life. As it proceeded, however, it met and united
with another great current, and the sweep and impetuosity of
the two combined carried with them the whole life of the nation,
as neither could have done alone. Much had been borne by
the people during the reign of Elizabeth, which it had become
increasingly evident toward her end that they would not submit
to under any successor. The early years of the Stuart
dynasty indicated that a constitutional struggle, far transcending
the religious, was in preparation. It was by no means
true that all of those who were opposed to the King's views as
to his prerogative agreed with the Puritan views as to prelacy;
but in the case of many individuals, the two revolts were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>merged into one; and in any case, the two movements, being
both directed against the government, would tend to unite,
in order to make common cause against the same enemy,
though to attain their several ends. It is true that, in the long
run, the leading ideas of the Reformation led toward liberty
and equality, especially through the influence of that widely
diffused education which was a corollary of the new attitude
toward the Bible. It is a fallacy, however, to believe, because
certain results have followed certain causes, that, therefore,
those results were striven for by the men who endeavored to
put those causes into motion, for the purpose, perhaps, of
securing results of quite another sort. The Puritan, at least,
was no more a believer in the political rights of an individual
as such, or in democracy, than in religious toleration, and the
leaders in Massachusetts denounced both with equal vehemence.
Calvin himself, who most fully represents the political
philosophy of the movement, was inconsistent and confused in
his thought on the subject; and, as Gooch has said, “modern
democracy is the child of the Reformation, not of the Reformers.”<a id='r187'></a><a href='#f187' class='c014'><sup>[187]</sup></a>
The Reformation was much broader than the
Puritan groupings, and so was reform in the state; but the
political leaders realized the great force to be added to the
struggle for civil liberty, and welcomed the burning zeal of
the religious malcontents. Thus arose the Puritan party,
strong alike in numbers and in purpose, and composed, like all
parties, of men infinitely varying in views and character.
Their united forces helped at once to create civil liberty under
the law and to establish a tyranny of public opinion.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have already seen some of the incentives that induced
men to become Puritans. As the movement grew, worldly
motives, aside from the purely religious or purely patriotic,
would tend to influence an increasing number. We have noted
above how the financial sacrifice was frequently made by the
Churchman and not by the Puritan. Indeed, “many of wit
and parts,” wrote one of the most attractive of English Puritan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>women, “who could not obtain the preferment their ambition
gaped at, would declare themselves of the puritan party,”
while “others, that had neither learning, nor friends, nor opportunities
to arrive to any preferments, would put on a form
of godliness, finding devout people that way so liberal to them,
that they could not hope to enrich themselves so much in any
other way.”<a id='r188'></a><a href='#f188' class='c014'><sup>[188]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Moreover, there had for some time been growing up into
prominence a new class, which we now call the middle, and
which had had no assigned position under the feudal form of
society. In the Stuart period, this class was, for the first time,
to impress its character deeply upon national affairs. The
activities by which, during the preceding two centuries or more,
its members had been gradually rising into their new position
had given a marked quality to their minds and characters.
Looked down upon by the noble, and disliked by the peasant,
they returned these feelings with interest. When the noble
disdained their birth and breeding, they in turn condemned the
immorality of those above them in both. Again the element
of negation entered, and the Puritan fostered an ideal which
was the reverse of the lives of those who looked down upon him.
Puritanism became the “reasoned expression of the middle-class
state of mind,”<a id='r189'></a><a href='#f189' class='c014'><sup>[189]</sup></a> which it has always remained.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among the leaders, however, as among the middle class and
country gentry, there was a group which had a very great influence,
not only upon the party in England, but upon colonization
in America, and which will concern us more directly. We
must now turn to examine the settlement of those two colonies
in the New World which represented, in the main, the earlier
religious, and the later economic and political, aspects of the
English Puritan movement.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER V<br> <br> THE FIRST PERMANENT SETTLEMENTS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In 1606, in the obscure English village of Scrooby, in Nottinghamshire,
a little group of men, which included John Robinson,
William Brewster, and William Bradford, had for some
years been meeting together in Brewster's house for worship,
and had formed themselves into an Independent church. Robinson
was a graduate of Cambridge, and had been a Church of
England clergyman in Norwich.<a id='r190'></a><a href='#f190' class='c014'><sup>[190]</sup></a> Brewster, after a short
attendance at Cambridge, had become connected, in some
capacity, with Davison, then Secretary of State, and had
accompanied him to the Low Countries in 1585. When Davison
fell from power, Brewster's career at court was ended, and
at the time of the formation of the church in Scrooby, he had,
for some years, been occupying the position of postmaster there,
living in the old manor-house which had attracted the covetous
eyes of James the First.<a id='r191'></a><a href='#f191' class='c014'><sup>[191]</sup></a> A spiritually minded man of some
culture but of modest means, he was the most influential layman
in the little congregation, which, for the most part, was
composed of the untutored farmers and farm-hands of that
remote rural district. With little or no education, without
even that sharpening of wits which comes from mere contact
in the more populous ways of life, they were, as their own historian
has said, only such as had been “used to a plaine countrie
life and the innocent trade of husbandry.”<a id='r192'></a><a href='#f192' class='c014'><sup>[192]</sup></a> That historian,
William Bradford, was himself of yeoman stock, and a mere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>lad of sixteen or so, when the Scrooby church was formed.<a id='r193'></a><a href='#f193' class='c014'><sup>[193]</sup></a>
Already one of the leaders in the practical affairs of the church
when scarcely more than a lad, he developed into a man of
sound judgment, as well as morals, and one whose counsel was
to be invaluable to the little colony in the New World, the
fortunes of which he was to share and chronicle. A student,
and a writer of a singularly pure English style, he seems also
to have made himself familiar with Dutch, French, Latin,
Greek, and Hebrew, if we may believe Cotton Mather's statement,
which is, in part, borne out by other evidence.<a id='r194'></a><a href='#f194' class='c014'><sup>[194]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The persecution that the little band underwent before the
year of their attempt to emigrate to Holland was, in the main,
from neither church nor state, but only such as they had to
suffer from the scoffs and jeers of their more easy-going and
more commonplace neighbors and companions. In 1607,
however, some one or more of these latter, possibly from a
neighborly desire to pay off a grudge, apparently laid a complaint
before the ecclesiastical authorities, of which the Commissioners
of the Province of York had to take note; and in
November, Neville, Brewster, and seven others were cited to
appear. Neville, who did so, was allowed to testify without
taking the usual oath, and, after a short confinement, was
released without further trial. Fines were imposed upon the
others for non-appearance, but beyond that no action seems
to have been taken, nor were any efforts made to apprehend
them.</p>

<p class='c001'>According to the standards of the day, they were treated
with leniency, and there is little to indicate that they were
“harried from the land,” or that either the civil or ecclesiastical
authorities were anxious to interfere with them.<a id='r195'></a><a href='#f195' class='c014'><sup>[195]</sup></a> Justly
dreading, however, what might happen, rather than what had
happened, and, perhaps, partly influenced by some of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>motives which induced them to leave Holland later, they
decided to flee from England secretly, and to establish a church
in Amsterdam, whither a neighboring congregation had already
gone. To take their departure legally, it would have been
necessary to get the consent of the authorities—a matter having
nothing more to do with religion than the granting of passports
to-day. Neither money nor goods were allowed to leave
England without governmental permit; and, as the Scrooby
group intended to take both without such authorization, they
had to leave clandestinely. About one hundred of them made
the attempt, but were betrayed to the customs officers by the
captain of the ship that was to transport them. A certain
amount of the discomfort and unpleasant notoriety to which
these simple and modest folk objected was undoubtedly of
necessity incidental to the simultaneous arrest of so large a
body of law-breakers. They were temporarily placed in confinement,
for this purely secular offense, and were well treated
by the magistrates, who “used them courteously, and showed
them what favour they could.”<a id='r196'></a><a href='#f196' class='c014'><sup>[196]</sup></a> The Privy Council, which
had to be advised of the attempt to evade the customs laws,
acted promptly; and, in spite of the slow communication in
those days, within a month all but seven, who were considered
the ringleaders of the fugitives, were released and sent to
their homes. The seven, of whom Brewster was one, were also
freed later, apparently without even having been tried.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some of the party reached Holland safely that autumn, and
others made another attempt some months after. At the very
moment of embarking from an out-of-the-way place, they were
surprised by some of the country people, who notified the
authorities, and such of the passengers as had not got on
board were again taken into custody. Although they were
known to be breaking the laws, apparently no justice or court
could be found to punish them; and, when again set at liberty,
they finally reached Holland in safety. Neither the Privy
Council nor the ecclesiastical authorities had taken any notice
of the matter. Not only had there been little or no religious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>persecution, but even when the refugees had obviously committed
civil crimes these were officially condoned.<a id='r197'></a><a href='#f197' class='c014'><sup>[197]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>After about a year in Amsterdam, owing to the quarrels that
marred the life of the church earlier established, the newcomers
decided to remove to Leyden, where they remained until
the eventful year 1620.<a id='r198'></a><a href='#f198' class='c014'><sup>[198]</sup></a> Their life in the old university town,
although hard in many ways, seems to have been singularly
peaceful, and wholly unmarred by any of those petty bickerings
and contentions so curiously characteristic of the ultra-godly
of the period. They seem, indeed, to have valued “peace and
their spirituall comforte above any other riches whatsoever,”
and to have lived together in “love and holiness,” as Bradford
wrote. Robinson was their minister, and Brewster their elder,
the latter eking out his income by teaching English and printing
Puritan books. The company generally set to trades and
handicrafts, by which “at length they came to raise a competente
and comforteable living,” and won the deserved respect
of their Dutch hosts.<a id='r199'></a><a href='#f199' class='c014'><sup>[199]</sup></a> They seem, however, to have lived
a life apart, and to have been but little influenced by the nation
with which they had cast their lot. In spite of extravagant
claims to the contrary, direct Dutch influence in New England,
as derived through the Pilgrims' sojourn in Holland, can be
traced in but one particular, that of marriage by a civil magistrate
instead of a clergyman.<a id='r200'></a><a href='#f200' class='c014'><sup>[200]</sup></a> At that time, Holland was, in
almost all respects, far ahead of England intellectually. In the
matter of religious toleration she was immeasurably in advance
of the rest of Europe. Dutch influence would have been a noble
one, indeed, in New England's history, but there is virtually
nothing to indicate its presence.<a id='r201'></a><a href='#f201' class='c014'><sup>[201]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>Although there were other English in Leyden, and, therefore,
the size of Robinson's congregation is difficult to determine
accurately, it seems to have numbered about two hundred at
the time that its members were considering their third emigration,
and had decided to leave Holland.<a id='r202'></a><a href='#f202' class='c014'><sup>[202]</sup></a> The reasons for this
decision, as given by Bradford, were the difficulty, for many,
of making a living, and the unlikelihood of attracting others;
the possibility that they would themselves disperse in time; the
temptations which beset their children; and their desire to
spread the gospel in the new world.<a id='r203'></a><a href='#f203' class='c014'><sup>[203]</sup></a> To these, Winslow, who
had joined the group about 1617, added their wish to remain
Englishmen; the inability to give their children as good an
education as they themselves had received; and the somewhat
ambiguous reason, “how little good we did or were like to do
to the Dutch in reforming the sabbath.”<a id='r204'></a><a href='#f204' class='c014'><sup>[204]</sup></a> Their motives were,
therefore, partly patriotic, partly economic, and partly religious,
the same which, in shifting proportions and embodied
in a very varied assortment of personalities, we find as mainsprings
of colonization from the beginning. The one constant
factor is the economic. No matter what other motives may
have induced any one, from John Cabot to the last arrival at
Ellis Island, to turn his face westward, added to them has ever
been the hope of bettering his economic condition. America
has always offered comparative material prosperity to the most
idealistic as well as to the most sordid. When this factor
ceases to operate, as in time, perhaps a short time, it must,
American history will enter upon a new phase.</p>

<p class='c001'>The little group of Englishmen in Leyden, who thus desired
to emigrate, were without means for any such undertaking.
Whatever their motives might be, it was evident that no
colony could be planted, in which they were concerned, unless
monied men, from the same or other motives, could be induced
to risk capital in what, so far, had constantly been proved a
very unprofitable business. English merchants and capitalists
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>had already spent vast sums in the attempt to turn America
to account, with but little success. The English-American
balance-sheet showed a colossal amount spent in exploration
and attempted development on the one page, and but a handful
of people in Virginia, a feeble beginning in Bermuda, and
the Newfoundland fishing fleet, on the other.</p>

<p class='c001'>At first, the Pilgrims did not seem to realize how inadequate
their resources were for such a project. Apparently, the question
which they discussed most was where they should go,
rather than how they should get there. Some of the more
substantial and important members advocated Guiana, as
they might there grow rich with little labor—which was a
very human ambition.<a id='r205'></a><a href='#f205' class='c014'><sup>[205]</sup></a> Fear of tropical diseases and the
Spaniard negatived this otherwise alluring plan. Thought of
possible persecution vetoed the next proposition also, which
was to settle somewhere near the colony already established
in Virginia. The final decision was to live under the government
of that company, but as a distinct body by themselves,
after a grant of religious freedom should have been procured
from the King. It is rather odd, in view of the persecution
which they thought they had undergone, and that which they
constantly seemed to fear, that they should have been so confident
that the King would consent in writing to an act so far
in advance of English thought. The fact that they had escaped
any rigorous attack in England, and that their illegal acts on
leaving had been condoned by the authorities, may have added
to their hope of being so tenderly treated, which was unreasonably
held out to them by “some great persons of good rancke
and qualitie.”<a id='r206'></a><a href='#f206' class='c014'><sup>[206]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In the fall of 1617, John Carver and Robert Cushman were
dispatched to London to confer with Sir Edwin Sandys about
the matter. Sandys was a brother of Sir Samuel Sandys, at
that time lessee of the Scrooby Manor, in which Brewster
had lived, and was favorably disposed toward the Leyden
people. He was also a member of the East India, Bermuda,
and Virginia companies, the last of which he was virtually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>managing at the time of the emissaries' arrival, owing to the
illness of that Company's treasurer.<a id='r207'></a><a href='#f207' class='c014'><sup>[207]</sup></a> The “Seven Articles
of the Church at Leyden,” which the Pilgrims had carefully
worded in the somewhat naïve expectation that they might
satisfy the authorities without committing themselves, were
privately submitted to some of the members of the Virginia
Council, and approved; so that Sandys wrote hopefully of the
prospects to Robinson and Brewster.<a id='r208'></a><a href='#f208' class='c014'><sup>[208]</sup></a> The upshot of the
matter, however, was what might have been expected, or was
perhaps even more favorable than should reasonably have
been hoped for under the circumstances. The King would
not grant them toleration under his “broad seale, according to
their desires,” which would naturally have got him into serious
difficulties politically; but, apparently, he did agree to “connive
at them, and not molest them, provided they carried
themselves peaceably.”<a id='r209'></a><a href='#f209' class='c014'><sup>[209]</sup></a> They wisely decided that, if this
were not enough, nothing would be, for, if the King meant to
wrong them “though they had a seale as broad as the house
floor, it would not serve the turne, for ther would be means
enow found to recall or revers it.”<a id='r210'></a><a href='#f210' class='c014'><sup>[210]</sup></a> With this and, perhaps,
the vain regret that they had not let sleeping dogs lie, they
had to be content.</p>

<p class='c001'>The next step was to secure a patent, and find “adventurers,”—as
men were still called who invested in such enterprises,—who
would supply the necessary money. Owing to the dissensions
in the Virginia Company, which now became acute, the negotiations
were delayed; but on April 19, 1619, that company
elected Sandys treasurer; and a patent, taken out in the name
of John Wincob, “comended to the Company by the Earle of
Lincolne,” received its seal June 9.<a id='r211'></a><a href='#f211' class='c014'><sup>[211]</sup></a> This was never made use
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>of, and apparently the one they intended to utilize was that
previously granted to John Pierce, on February 2, antedating
a later one to the same person.<a id='r212'></a><a href='#f212' class='c014'><sup>[212]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>During the following months, their efforts to raise money
became known both in Holland and in England. The Dutch,
now become the most important colonizing power, tried to induce
them to settle either in Zealand or on the Hudson River;
and they also received offers from an English merchant, Thomas
Weston, who ran over from London on the scent of business.
He finally prevailed upon them to make an agreement with
himself and his associates. His own motives, as amply proved
by events, were wholly mercenary, as were those of most of the
other outsiders who financed the enterprise. The planting of
the first permanent colony in New England was due to the desire
for gain on the part of these ordinary business men, who risked
a large sum, and made heavy losses, as well as to the higher
motives of some of the actual emigrants, whose character,
sense, and patience rescued the enterprise from disaster. The
infant colony was the child of two parents, and the share of
each in its creation must be recognized, even if one were vulgar
and sordid, and subsequently disinherited its offspring.</p>

<p class='c001'>The agreement, which became the subject of bitter controversy,
created a joint stock, divided into shares of £10 each.
Every person, over sixteen years of age, who went as an emigrant
received one share free, and a second if he fitted himself
out to that amount, or paid for his transportation. On the
one hand, the results of the entire labor of the colonists were
to go to this joint fund, and, on the other, all their food,
clothing, and other necessities were to be provided for them
out of the stock. At the end of seven years, the entire fund,
with its accumulations, including houses, lands, and cash on
hand, was to be divided, pro rata, among all the shareholders,
the expectation being that the profits would accrue mainly
from fishing and the Indian trade.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>The emigrants had anticipated that two days a week would
be allowed them for their own profit, and that, at the end of
the seven-year period, they would retain individual possession
of their houses and improved lands. Indeed, it was only after
they were so far committed to the scheme that many of them
could not well turn back, that they found this was not to be
the case.<a id='r213'></a><a href='#f213' class='c014'><sup>[213]</sup></a> The merchants, however, can hardly be blamed
for refusing to allow so large a vent for possible profits to slip
through. It was the general custom at the time for any one
going to the colonies, who could not pay his way, to become
an indentured servant for seven years in exchange for his transportation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The suggestion of the emigrants that one third of their
working time, and the permanent improvements, as well as
the land on which they lived, should accrue to themselves,
and in no part to those who were providing the means, must
have seemed as grasping to the Adventurers as their attitude,
in turn, seems to have been considered by the Pilgrims. The
exact amount put into the venture by the capitalists, during
their connection with it, cannot now be determined accurately;
but according to Captain John Smith, there were about seventy
of them, and the joint stock invested up to 1624 was
about £7,000.<a id='r214'></a><a href='#f214' class='c014'><sup>[214]</sup></a> The greater part must have been subscribed
by the Adventurers, not by the emigrants; so that, making
all due allowances for the share contributed by the latter, and
for returns made subsequently by their efforts in America, the
final loss on the part of the capitalists was very heavy. Their
judgment as to the risk their money was running was thus
unpleasantly justified. They were not subscribing to foreign
missions, but employing their capital in a purely business
venture, and the terms, as business was conducted at that
time, cannot be considered as at all harsh. Cushman, in
London, who was acting as agent for the Leyden people,
fearing the failure of the entire enterprise if the merchants'
terms were not accepted, exceeded his authority, and agreed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>to them, to the great resentment of his principals, who refused
to sign the revised contract.</p>

<p class='c001'>Meanwhile, a small ship, the Speedwell, which it was intended
to take to Virginia and keep there, had been bought in
Holland, and a larger one, the Mayflower, chartered in London
to carry the major part of the colony.<a id='r215'></a><a href='#f215' class='c014'><sup>[215]</sup></a> The two vessels were
to meet at Southampton, and make the passage together. It
had been decided that, if a majority of the congregation voted
to remain in Leyden, Robinson should stay with them, Brewster
becoming the spiritual leader of those who should go. As
this proved to be the case, the members of the little party
which at last sailed from Delft Haven there took their final
leave of their beloved pastor.<a id='r216'></a><a href='#f216' class='c014'><sup>[216]</sup></a> Their debt to him had been
great. His gentle spirit, humble seeking of ever more light,
and broad tolerance of mind, shone almost alone in that
period of intolerant dogmatism and persecuting zeal, alike
of Churchman and Puritan. “We ought,” he wrote, “to be
firmly persuaded in our hearts of the truth, and goodness of
the religion, which we embrace in all things; yet as knowing
ourselves to be men, whose property it is to err and to be
deceived in many things; and accordingly both to converse
with men in that modesty of mind, as always to desire to learn
something better, or further, by them, if it may be.”<a id='r217'></a><a href='#f217' class='c014'><sup>[217]</sup></a> He
recognized that “men are for the most part minded for, or
against toleration of diversity of religion, according to the
conformity which they themselves hold, or hold not, with the
country, or kingdom, where they live. Protestants living in
the countries of Papists commonly plead for toleration of
religion: so do Papists that live where Protestants bear sway:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>though few of either, <i>specially of the clergy</i>, as they are called,
would have the other tolerated, where the world goes on their
side.”<a id='r218'></a><a href='#f218' class='c014'><sup>[218]</sup></a> In his farewell address to his flock shortly before
their leaving, he dwelt particularly upon the need of their
being open-minded, for “he was very confident that the Lord
had more truth and light yet to break forth out of his holy
word,” and so his followers should “follow him no further
than he followed Christ.”<a id='r219'></a><a href='#f219' class='c014'><sup>[219]</sup></a> It is unlikely that such doctrines
were wholly grasped by all his humble followers, but the influence
of his life and teaching were felt long after in the little
church of Plymouth; and the spirit which, in general, animated
that colony must have been derived in large measure
from the rare spirituality of its first pastor in the Old
World.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the latter part of July the Speedwell reached Southampton,
where the Mayflower had already arrived, and whither
Weston had also gone for a final conference. On finding it impossible
to make the Pilgrims accept the changes in the agreement,
he left them, telling them “they must then looke to stand
on their own leggs,” and even refused to pay £100, which was
necessary to adjust matters in Southampton before their sailing.
Provisions were sold to settle the debt, and both ships
cleared for America early in August. Owing to the leakiness
of the small Speedwell, it was necessary to put back to Dartmouth,
where repairs were made. After a second start, the
Speedwell still giving trouble, both vessels put into Plymouth,
where it was decided to leave some of the company behind, and
proceed in the Mayflower alone.<a id='r220'></a><a href='#f220' class='c014'><sup>[220]</sup></a> One hundred and two passengers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>crowded into the little vessel, the company being made
up of thirty-five of the Leyden congregation and the remainder
from London.<a id='r221'></a><a href='#f221' class='c014'><sup>[221]</sup></a> Cushman stayed behind; but, on the other
hand, an invaluable accession was made in the person of Captain
Myles Standish. This little “Captain Shrimp,” as Morton
of Merry Mount nicknamed him, although not a Puritan, remained
a staunch friend to the colonists, and with his little
“army” of a dozen or less, stood as a shield between them and
their enemies, white and red. He was short in stature and in
temper. “A little chimney is soon fired,” Hubbard wrote of
him. But he could also be as gentle as he was valiant; and the
first service he rendered the infant colony was not in fighting
the Indians, but in tenderly nursing his new friends through
the sickness of the first winter.</p>

<p class='c001'>Finally, their “troubles being blowne over, and now all
being compacte togeather in one shipe, they put to sea againe
with a prosperous winde,” heavily laden with passengers, a
vast amount of ghostly furniture, and the first consignment
of the New England conscience. After falling in with Cape
Cod, on the 19th of November, they ran among dangerous
shoals in their effort to pass southward to reach Hudson's
river, and so resolved to put back, casting anchor two days
later in the harbor of Provincetown.<a id='r222'></a><a href='#f222' class='c014'><sup>[222]</sup></a> Much speculation has
been indulged in as to their reasons for not going farther;
but the obvious ones would seem as good as any, and there is
no cause to suspect treachery on the part of Captain Jones of
the Mayflower, the Dutch, or others.<a id='r223'></a><a href='#f223' class='c014'><sup>[223]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>As has been noted, only about one third of the company were
of the Leyden people. The other sixty-seven were evidently a
very mixed lot, comprising undesirable characters, as well as
some excellent ones. As it was now decided to settle in the
nearest suitable spot, they knew that they would be outside
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>the jurisdiction of the Virginia Company, and, therefore, also
outside the bounds of their own patent. Some of the London
element, taking advantage of that fact, boasted openly that
they did not intend to be ruled by anyone, but “would use
their owne libertie.”<a id='r224'></a><a href='#f224' class='c014'><sup>[224]</sup></a> It was evident to the more substantial
members that, if order were to be maintained on shore, some
responsible government would have to be created, backed by
sufficient show of public opinion and force to keep the unruly
in subjection. Before anyone was permitted to land, therefore,
the famous Mayflower Compact was drawn up, by which the
signers agreed to combine themselves into a “civill body politick”
for their order and preservation, and by virtue of it to
enact necessary laws and to elect officers.<a id='r225'></a><a href='#f225' class='c014'><sup>[225]</sup></a> This short document,
the body of which is but seven lines, was not intended
to be a new departure in state constitutions, but was a perfectly
simple extension of the ordinary form of church covenant,
with which they were familiar, to cover the crisis in their
civil affairs which they now faced. As events developed,
however, it came about that the Compact remained the only
basis on which the independent civil government in Plymouth
rested, as the colonists were never able to get a charter conferring
rights of jurisdiction. It was the first example of that
“plantation covenant” which was to form the basis of the
river towns of Connecticut, of New Haven, and of so many
other town and colony governments in that land of covenants,
ecclesiastical and civil.<a id='r226'></a><a href='#f226' class='c014'><sup>[226]</sup></a> From the exigencies of the case,
rather than from any preconceived philosophical notions, the
first settlers thus established a pure democracy, which was
subsequently modified. At first, however, the entire male
population met in a body which constituted a General Court,
and was the source of all local political power and judicial
decisions.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The document was signed by forty-one men, of whom only
seventeen were from Leyden. It may here be noted that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>usual historical method of approach to the settlement of
Plymouth, which is by way of Scrooby and Holland, is, to a
certain extent, misleading. The capital, which made the
enterprise possible, was practically all subscribed in London.
Of the first emigrants but a third belonged to Robinson's
congregation, and, in the entire Pilgrim movement to America,
only a dozen or so persons, at most, can be even remotely
traced to the neighborhood of Scrooby.<a id='r227'></a><a href='#f227' class='c014'><sup>[227]</sup></a> It is true that the
Scrooby leaven, in the persons of Brewster and Bradford, and
the influence of Robinson, leavened the whole Plymothean
mass; but, if we had the documents, which we have not, it
would be instructive to hear the story from the standpoint of
the Londoners, both capitalists and colonists.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first few weeks were occupied in searching for a site for
settlement; and it was only on the third expedition in their
little shallop that the exploring party finally landed at Plymouth,
on December 21.<a id='r228'></a><a href='#f228' class='c014'><sup>[228]</sup></a> Having found the harbor fit for
shipping, and the site possible for a settlement, they decided
to search no farther. “It was the best they could find, and
the season, and their presente necessitie, made them glad to
accepte of it,” wrote Bradford, somewhat unenthusiastically.<a id='r229'></a><a href='#f229' class='c014'><sup>[229]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Five days later, the Mayflower herself arrived from Provincetown,
and the people began the erection of the first common
house for themselves and their goods—a log hut about
twenty feet square, with a thatched roof. Soon, however,
they abandoned building in common, and “agreed that every
man should build his own house, thinking that by that course
men would make more haste,” so promptly did human nature
and winter's cold assert themselves over theory. The season,
though stormy, happily proved unusually mild. Fortunately,
also, the great sickness which had recently decimated the
Indians, had killed off almost the entire native population
about Plymouth and Massachusetts bays, and completely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>broken the spirit of the remainder, though this was as yet unknown
to the settlers, who lived in constant fear of attack.<a id='r230'></a><a href='#f230' class='c014'><sup>[230]</sup></a>
They occupied but a clearing on the edge of the vast and
unknown wilderness. Mysterious and unexplored, it stretched
interminably before them, while the midwinter North Atlantic
tossed as endlessly behind them. In the woods, Indian yells
had been heard, and an occasional savage had been seen skulking
behind cover. John Goodman, going for a walk one evening
with his dog, suddenly found the small beast taking refuge
between his legs, chased by two wolves. He threw a stick at
them, whereupon “they sat both on their tails grinning at
him a good while.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Soon, owing to exposure, many of the settlers fell ill; and so
quickly did the disease spread, and so fatal were its effects,
that by the end of March forty-four, or nearly one half of the
little company, were dead. Sometimes two or three died in
a day, and but six or seven were well enough to nurse the
living and bury the corpses. Their kindness and courage
under these trials were beyond all praise. Before the arrival
of the first supply ship, in the following autumn, six more
had died, including the governor, Carver, so that only one half
the company remained. But the little colony was not to be
crushed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Bradford was elected in Carver's place, and in March, in
spite of the terrors which encompassed them, in spite of the
graves of the dead, which far outnumbered the homes of the
living, Winslow could yet note that “the birds sang in the
woods most pleasantly.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Suddenly, toward the end of that month, at the very moment
when they were debating questions of defense, an Indian
walked boldly into the settlement, and bade them welcome in
English. The savage, Samoset by name, proceeded to give
them much useful information about the natives, and from
him, apparently, the settlers first learned of the great mortaliy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>among them. After spending the night, he was dismissed
with gifts, promising to bring others of the natives with
him on his return. This he did a few days later, the savages
bringing with them some tools which they had stolen a while
before, and which they now restored. A week later, Samoset
and another Indian, named Squanto, who was the only survivor
of the group which had dwelt where the Pilgrims had
settled, came to announce the arrival of the great sachem himself,
Massasoit. With him, the settlers made a treaty of
peace and friendship, which was honorably maintained on
both sides for over half a century, the Indian proving himself
a loyal friend to the English until his death in 1662.<a id='r231'></a><a href='#f231' class='c014'><sup>[231]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The sachem's visit was returned in July, Winslow and Hopkins
making the journey of forty miles, with the ever-useful
Squanto as guide. During the summer, the colonists were
joined also by another Indian, Hobomack, who made his home
with them, and continued faithful during his life. In spite of
some minor troubles, due to the childish jealousy and desire
to appear important on the part of the two savages, the
debt that the settlers owed to them cannot be overestimated.
They not only served as interpreters and intermediaries with
the other Indians, but taught the colonists how to plant and
manure the native corn and where to catch fish, acted as
guides about the country, and made themselves generally invaluable.
These services were not regarded wholly with favor
by some of the Indians who were opposed to the whites, and
the settlers had to teach the sachem Corbitant a sharp lesson,
to make them leave their two Indian friends alone.<a id='r232'></a><a href='#f232' class='c014'><sup>[232]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Mayflower, having been detained by the sickness of her
crew, as well as by that prevailing on shore, until the middle of
April, had then sailed for home, none of the planters abandoning
the enterprise to sail with her. Needless to say, there had
been no opportunity to gather cargo to send to the merchants
in England before her sailing. With the summer, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>health had returned, and there had been a moderate degree
of comfort, as well as abundance of food, at Plymouth; so that
in September, under the guidance of Squanto, the Pilgrims
undertook their first trading voyage, sailing to Massachusetts
Bay. Their plan had been both to explore the country and
to make peace with the Indians of that district, as well as to
“procure their truck.” Although gone only four days, the
little party of thirteen, under command of Standish, were
eminently successful in all three objects, making the first beginning,
on any large scale, of that trade which was to prove
their financial salvation. In fact the Bible and the beaver
were the two mainstays of the young colony. The former
saved its morale, and the latter paid its bills; and the rodent's
share was a large one. The original foundations of New York,
New England, and Canada all rest on the Indian trade, in
which the item of beaver-skins was by far the most important
and lucrative.</p>

<p class='c001'>Having thus got together a good store of pelts and some
clapboards, they were able to despatch the Fortune, which
had arrived in November, back to England within a fortnight
after her arrival, with their first consignment, worth £500, all
of which was lost to them by the capture of the ship by the
French.<a id='r233'></a><a href='#f233' class='c014'><sup>[233]</sup></a> A long letter from Weston, brought from England
by Cushman, complained bitterly and unreasonably of their
having returned no cargo in the Mayflower, and also brought
word that a new patent had been obtained for them from the
Council of New England, in the name of John Pierce and his
associates.<a id='r234'></a><a href='#f234' class='c014'><sup>[234]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>There had also arrived on the Fortune thirty-five persons to
remain in the colony, evidently sent by the merchants, and
with practically no supplies of any kind. They were made
welcome by the Pilgrims, who were ever hospitable, not alone
to those who differed from them in doctrine, but even to their
avowed enemies, so long as either needed their help. Bradford
noted that they were glad of this addition to their strength,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>though he “wished that many of them had been of better condition,
and all of them better furnished with provisions.”
The colonists, who had but recently been congratulating themselves
on having ample food for the coming winter, due to their
own efforts, had now to be put on very short commons; and
it was not until the gathering of the crops in the autumn of
the following year that they again had a sufficient supply.</p>

<p class='c001'>The addition to their numbers, however, must have increased
their feeling of security in the Indian troubles which soon
threatened them. The powerful Narragansetts, who were hostile
both to the Pilgrims and to their native allies, and who
had suffered but slightly from the plague, sent them a challenge
in the form of a bundle of arrows tied in a snake-skin. Squanto
having interpreted the message, they returned the skin stuffed
with powder and shot, with word to the natives that “if they
had rather have warr then peace, they might begin when they
would.” Nevertheless, in spite of their “high words and lofty
looks,” Winslow wrote, they were not a little anxious, and took
all the precautions possible, including the building of a palisade
about the village. Nothing came of the episode, however,
except the anxiety of the settlers, which was increased
the following summer by the receipt of a letter telling them of
the great and sudden massacre at Jamestown.<a id='r235'></a><a href='#f235' class='c014'><sup>[235]</sup></a> So greatly
were they then worried that they faced another winter of short
rations more willingly than they did the savages, and took
much valuable time from the tilling of their crops for the building
of a fort.</p>

<p class='c001'>Until the great immigration into Massachusetts Bay, in
1630, Plymouth continued to be the largest single settlement
in New England; but, from 1622 onward, there were scattered
beginnings at other points along the coast, many of which
proved permanent. Gorges endeavored to put new life into
colonization, and in that year published his “Briefe Narration”
of the efforts he had made heretofore.<a id='r236'></a><a href='#f236' class='c014'><sup>[236]</sup></a> In less than two months
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>after the granting of Pierce's patent for the benefit of the Pilgrims,
another grant was made to Captain John Mason of all
the lands lying between the Naumkeag and Merrimac rivers,
and extending from their heads to the seacoast, thus including
the shore from Salem to Newburyport.<a id='r237'></a><a href='#f237' class='c014'><sup>[237]</sup></a> In August, a third
grant was passed, to Mason and Gorges jointly, of the coast
from the Merrimac eastward to the Kennebec, extending sixty
miles inland, and including all islands within fifteen miles of
the shore, to be called the Province of Maine.<a id='r238'></a><a href='#f238' class='c014'><sup>[238]</sup></a> Other grants
were also made in the same year,<a id='r239'></a><a href='#f239' class='c014'><sup>[239]</sup></a> and a small settlement may
have been begun at Nantasket.<a id='r240'></a><a href='#f240' class='c014'><sup>[240]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Of more immediate interest to the people of Plymouth than
paper principalities or small fishing stations, of which there
were probably many along the coast, used annually at certain
seasons, was the attempt made by their own financial backer,
Thomas Weston, to establish a private and rival trading colony
almost at their very door. Profits not having come in as rapidly
as he had anticipated, he had sold out his holdings in the
enterprise to his associates, and now intended to plant and
trade for his own account, getting all he could from the Pilgrims.
Although he attempted to misrepresent the new relation
which he now bore toward them, it was not long before they
learned the truth from their friends at home. Toward the end
of May, a small shallop arrived with seven of his men, whom
he had detached from a fishing vessel of his at Damaris Cove,
near Monhegan, and sent to Plymouth to be cared for. Soon
followed word of his having broken with the company, and of
his having procured a separate patent for himself. By the
vessel which brought this news arrived also sixty more of his
colonists, who were set ashore at Plymouth, by the Charity,
which then proceeded to Virginia. Well and sick, the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>sixty-seven remained a burden upon the Pilgrims, until, the
Charity having returned, they sailed in her to Wessagusset,
now Weymouth, where they seated themselves. An unruly
crew, with no leadership, and utterly unfitted for colonizing,
they were soon short of provisions. A joint voyage to the
southward, made by some of them and of the Pilgrims, resulted
in securing but little corn, the expedition having had to be
abandoned on account of the death of Squanto, who, as usual,
was serving as guide.</p>

<p class='c001'>As the winter passed, the Wessagusset men slowly starved.
Their attitude toward the natives was the height of folly, and
the somewhat hostile Massachusetts Indians, perceiving their
plight, formed a plot to exterminate both settlements at once.
This was revealed to the Pilgrims by Massasoit, who, at this
most opportune moment, had been cured by them of what his
followers had thought a deadly sickness. The crisis was a
serious one, and the Pilgrims acted promptly. Feigning a
trading voyage, Standish and eight men went to Wessagusset,
inveigled the ringleaders into one of the houses, and there slew
them. Pecksuot, who had personally insulted Standish, was
killed with his own knife, which the captain snatched from
around his neck; and, in all, six savages were slain on the
expedition. Three of Weston's men, who, in spite of warnings,
had gone to stay with the Indians, were murdered by them in
retaliation. Most of the remainder, refusing the Pilgrims'
offer to care for them at Plymouth, sailed for Monhegan, in
the hope of finding passage to England.<a id='r241'></a><a href='#f241' class='c014'><sup>[241]</sup></a> Weston himself,
arriving soon after, found his colony deserted, and himself
ruined. On reaching Plymouth, after having been robbed and
stripped by the Indians, he unblushingly borrowed capital
from the compassionate Pilgrims in order to set himself up as
a trader.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another of the capitalists also gave the Pilgrims trouble by
trying the same plan of planting a colony of his own. On the
30th of April, 1622, Pierce, in whose name their patent stood,
obtained another, which, on the same day, he exchanged for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>a deed-pole, by which he became the owner of the lands on
which Plymouth was settled. Having thus cut the ground
from under the Pilgrims' feet, he proceeded to send out a hundred
and nine colonists for his own account. The ship was
forced to turn back, however; and finally, the Pilgrims, on
making complaint to the Council for New England, had their
original rights confirmed, upon payment to Pierce of £500.<a id='r242'></a><a href='#f242' class='c014'><sup>[242]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>These troubles, which occupied their minds in the early
summer of 1623, were soon followed by the arrival of Captain
West, who had been commissioned Admiral of New England,
and sent to collect license fees from the fishermen along the
coast. These proved to be “stuborne fellows,” however, and
the only result of West's brief attempt at authority was to
bring up anew in Parliament the fight for free fishing and
the opposition to the monopoly created by the New England
Council. Robert Gorges also came over as Governor of New
England, accompanied by the Rev. William Morell, who was
to superintend ecclesiastical affairs in the interest of the Church
of England; but, although Gorges spent the winter at Weston's
abandoned site, nothing more came of this high-sounding
scheme to govern the wilderness.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among the passengers in the Anne, which arrived at Plymouth
in the same summer of 1623, were some few who were
not to belong to the general body, or be subject to the rules
of joint trading, but came on “their perticuler,” as Bradford
describes it. An agreement was soon made with them, debarring
them from the Indian trade until the period of joint
trading should end, and otherwise defining their status in the
community. Such an anomalous group within the body politic
naturally tended to trouble, nor were leaders lacking who endeavored
to fan the sparks into a blaze. Among the “perticulers”
was a rough-and-ready trader named John Oldham, a
man of considerable practical ability, but heady, self-willed,
and of an ungovernable temper. In the following spring appeared
also a canting hypocritical clergyman, John Lyford
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>by name, who seems to have been a sort of lascivious Uriah
Heep. Pretending great humility, he was honorably received
by the Pilgrims, as they thought befitting a clergyman, and
was given a seat in the Governor's Council. Soon, however,
he and Oldham joined forces, and gathered together the various
malcontents of the colony, without any very clear idea,
apparently, beyond that of fishing in troubled waters, in the
hope of making some profitable catch. The waters were
troubled enough at this juncture, for the factions among the
Adventurers at home were then at their height. To the party
there adverse to the Pilgrim interest, Oldham and Lyford
dispatched letters, containing matter distinctly inimical to
the established order. These were read and copied by Bradford,
in the cabin of the ship which was to bear them, unknown
to the senders. The latter, indeed, had some suspicions, and
“were somewhat blanke at it, but after some weeks, when they
heard nothing, they were as brisk as ever,” like boys relieved
from the fear of having been caught in mischief. In fact, they
became so brisk that Oldham, when called upon to do his turn
of guard duty by Standish, refused and raised a tumult.</p>

<p class='c001'>The grotesque effect of their next stroke was naturally lost
upon people who, with all their excellent qualities, were, unhappily
for themselves, very obviously lacking in the saving
grace of humor. The curiously assorted couple decided to set
up a church of their own. The thought of Oldham, “a mad
Jack in his mood,” and the sniveling clergyman, whose innumerable
light loves had brought so many heavy sorrows, reforming
the Pilgrims' church is one of the bits which lighten
the somewhat sombre recital of those frontier days. A General
Court was convened, and the two were brought to trial. Both
of them were sentenced to banishment, Oldham to go at
once, and Lyford to have six months' grace, although the
former seems to have been rather the more respectable, as
he was much the more masculine, of the two. Oldham went,
but, having nursed his wrath, he suddenly returned in March,
for the sole purpose, apparently, of exploding it upon the yet
unreformed Pilgrims, who, however, merely “committed him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>till he was tamer.” Lyford, meanwhile, had utilized his reprieve
to write home again, criticizing the government of the
colony, and making some just complaints, on the part of the
large minority, of the required conformity of worship. The
sentence of banishment was then enforced, and both rebels
betook themselves temporarily to Nantasket.<a id='r243'></a><a href='#f243' class='c014'><sup>[243]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In the same summer in which the Pilgrims had acquired
Lyford and Oldham, an addition of about sixty other persons
had also been made to the colony, some of them “very usefull”
to the settlers, and some of them “so bad, as they were faine
to be at charge to send them home againe the next year.”<a id='r244'></a><a href='#f244' class='c014'><sup>[244]</sup></a>
Other settlements, too, continued to be planted along the coast.
Robert Gorges, who had received a grant of some three hundred
square miles on the northeast side of Massachusetts Bay,
but who had settled his men at Wessagusset, left some of them
there when he returned to England, and the permanent occupation
of that section was begun.<a id='r245'></a><a href='#f245' class='c014'><sup>[245]</sup></a> In 1623, David Thompson
established himself at the mouth of the Piscataqua; while
Edward and William Hilton may soon after have settled some
miles up the river, thus founding the modern towns of Portsmouth
and Dover. Christopher Levett, who was one of Robert
Gorges's Council, made a short-lived plantation at York,
and a permanent colony was effected on Monhegan.<a id='r246'></a><a href='#f246' class='c014'><sup>[246]</sup></a> For the
greater convenience of their fishing operations, which were
never successful, the Pilgrims had secured a grant of land at
Cape Ann, and erected a fishing stage there, although the grant,
which was derived from Lord Sheffield, was of questionable
validity.<a id='r247'></a><a href='#f247' class='c014'><sup>[247]</sup></a> A fishing company was formed of Dorchester men
in England, who made a little settlement on the Cape, holding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>it of the Plymouth people.<a id='r248'></a><a href='#f248' class='c014'><sup>[248]</sup></a> Although the undertaking was
unprofitable, and always a source of trouble to the Pilgrims, it
is of interest owing to the connection with it of some of those
who were later influential in England in organizing the Massachusetts
colony.</p>

<p class='c001'>About 1625, individuals also seem to have established themselves
at Shawmut, at Noddle's Island, and on the Mystic
River; and, a year later, Thompson removed from the Piscataqua,
and settled on the island which has since borne his
name in Boston Harbor.<a id='r249'></a><a href='#f249' class='c014'><sup>[249]</sup></a> Farther eastward, John Brown, by
1625, had founded a settlement at New Harbor, on the eastern
shore of Pemaquid; and in the next five years, eighty-four
families had located there, on St. Georges River, and at
Sheepscot.<a id='r250'></a><a href='#f250' class='c014'><sup>[250]</sup></a> A station had also been established at Old
Orchard Bay, while the importance of Monhegan as a centre
for Indian trading is proved by large transactions there as
early as 1626.<a id='r251'></a><a href='#f251' class='c014'><sup>[251]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Thus, the inhabitants of Plymouth, after the middle of the
first decade of their settlement, were evidently outnumbered
by the other permanent settlers, who were likewise founding
New England. Some of these we know to have been of the
established Church, as were Gorges and Mason, the proprietors
of a large section of the territory; while of the majority,
we know only that they were traders and planters, who were
quite evidently in New England to make their fortunes, and
for no other reason.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1625, there sailed into Boston Bay and New England history,
a certain “man of pretie parts,” by name Captain Wollaston,
a convivial sport named Thomas Morton, and “a great
many servants, with provisions and other implements for to
begine a plantation.” Among the implements was obviously
a prodigious supply of strong waters. They “pitched themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>in a place” within the present town of Quincy, calling
their settlement Mt. Wollaston, after their leader. He, however,
like some others before and since, did not find life in New
England to “answer his expectations,” and carried off a number
of his servants to Virginia, where he sold them at a good
figure, and took his exit from the stage of history.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thomas Morton, of Cliffords Inn, Gent., whose literary portrait
has come down to us in the somewhat unreliable form of
an appreciation by himself, supplemented by sundry exceedingly
unflattering sketches by his enemies, now proceeded to
take control of the situation in a manner entirely satisfactory
to himself, the rest of the stranded Quincy band, and, it was
darkly rumored, the less virtuous of the Indian squaws. He
suggested to the remaining servants that, instead of allowing
themselves to be transported to Virginia, they should stay
with him as copartners, he having had a share in the enterprise;
and that, together, they should thrust out Wollaston's lieutenant.
To this they willingly agreed, and matters proceeded
merrily. Morton, who, whatever his failings, was a thorough
sportsman and passionately fond of outdoor life, became a
great favorite with the Indians, and trade was brisk. It must
have been, if Bradford's report that they sometimes drank
ten pounds' worth of liquor in a morning is to be credited,
as the liquor certainly was not. “They also set up a May-pole,”
wrote the scandalized Pilgrim, “drinking and dancing
aboute it many days togeather, inviting the Indian women,
for their consorts, dancing and frisking together like so many
fairies or furies” and revived “the beasley practicses of the
madd Bacchanalians.”<a id='r252'></a><a href='#f252' class='c014'><sup>[252]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The joy of life had, indeed, made one other feeble effort to
acclimatize itself in the frosty New England air on Christmas
Day, in Plymouth, four years before. Most of the then recent
arrivals, constituting, perhaps, a third of the entire community,
had had the hardihood to wish to refrain from work on that
day, and to celebrate it “in the streete at play, openly” with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>such ungodliness as pitching a bar and playing ball.<a id='r253'></a><a href='#f253' class='c014'><sup>[253]</sup></a> That,
however, with a certain show of grim humor, had been successfully
repressed, as was the May-pole of Merry Mount, on the
arrival of Endicott in Massachusetts.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the echoes of Morton's mad songs died for the last
time among the pines of Quincy, rigid conformity to the
Puritanical code of manners and morals had won its second
victory. Repression and conformity, the two key-notes of
Puritan New England, were to continue to mould the life of
her people throughout the long “glacial age” of her early
history. They did not, indeed, produce universal morality,
but they produced the outward semblance of it, and a vast
deal of hypocrisy. If they must revel, Bradford told the ball-players,
let them do it out of sight, “since which time nothing
hath been attempted that way, at least openly.” Twenty
years later, as he meditated upon the extraordinary amount
of crime of unnamable sorts, which, as he wrote, had developed
in New England “as in no place more, or so much, that I have
known or heard of,” the possibility did, indeed, occur to him
that, among other reasons, it might be “as it is with waters
when their streams are stopped or damed up, when they gett
passage they flow with more violence.”<a id='r254'></a><a href='#f254' class='c014'><sup>[254]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In spite of the good which Puritanism did as a protest against
the prevailing immorality, it must be admitted also, that, in
taking from the laboring classes and others so much of their
opportunity for recreation of all sorts, it undoubtedly fostered
greatly the grosser forms of vice, and helped to multiply the
very sins it most abhorred. Those who lacked the taste or
temperament to find their relief from the deadly monotony of
long hours of toil in theological exposition, and who were debarred
from their old-time sports, turned to drunkenness and
sexual immorality, both of which were frequent in Puritan
New England.</p>

<p class='c001'>The attempt to erect the moral opinion of a minority into a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>legal code binding upon all was not, by any means, confined
to that section alone at the beginning of the seventeenth century.
It was, and is, a characteristic of Puritanism wherever
found. At the very time that Bradford was condemning the
Christmas sports of Plymouth, the authorities in Bermuda, for
example, were passing laws requiring that there should be
haled to court all “Sabath breakers” who were such “by
absenting themselves from church, or leaving during service,”
or “by using any bodily recreation by gaminge, sportinge, or
by doing any servile work as travelling, fyshinge, cuttinge of
wood, digginge of potatoes, carryinge of burdens, beatinge of
corne,” together with a long list of other misdemeanors. New
England Sabbatarian legislation never went further. Even
that petty spying upon one another, to detect sins to be reported
to the church, which must have been such an unpleasant
form of keeping one's brother in New England, was by no
means indigenous there. The “churchwardens and sydesmen,”
continued the Bermudian law, “shall dailie observe the
carriage and lives of the people, and shall forthwith informe
the ministers of all such scandalous crymes as shall be comitted
by any of them.”<a id='r255'></a><a href='#f255' class='c014'><sup>[255]</sup></a> Such quotations from the statute books
of the other colonies could be multiplied almost indefinitely.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Puritan seed was sown on many soils, and if it took root
and flourished so abundantly in New England as there to
crowd out the flowers of the field to a greater extent than elsewhere,
it was due in part to the nature of the actual soil which
the Puritan himself had to till. We have already noted how
the geographical features of the region fostered the classes of
fishermen, small traders, subsistence farmers, and townsmen;
how it prevented the growth of a large land-owning or slave-owning
population; how, in a word, it produced a society
which was largely democratic and almost wholly middle-class.
Moreover, in the discussion of Puritanism, we noticed how that
movement was strongest, struck its roots deepest, and assumed
its most uncompromising form, in the very class which thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>became almost synonymous with the New England population.</p>

<p class='c001'>To return to Merry Mount, however, it must be conceded
that there were more serious things wrong there than merely
heavy drinking and loose living. Morton, led by cupidity,
had made the fatal error of selling fire-arms to the Indians.
Needless to say, the profits, in beaver, of such a trade, were
enormous; but it threatened the life of every white man on
the coast, and residents of the scattered settlements asked
Plymouth to join with them in suppressing the deadly mischief.
Morton, after a brief struggle, of which he gives an
amusing account, was taken into custody, and shipped to
England with a complaint to the Council for New England.</p>

<p class='c001'>The cost of the expedition, which had been led by Standish,
amounted to a little over £12, borne by eight settlements, of
which the inhabitants of Plymouth outnumbered all the other
seven together.<a id='r256'></a><a href='#f256' class='c014'><sup>[256]</sup></a> That colony, however, contributed but one
sixth of the money spent, for which several reasons might be
suggested. During the years of its existence, it had received
practically no help from the capitalists at home, subsequent
to the first fitting out, and the really great achievement of its
leaders had consisted in maintaining, for the first time, the
existence of a plantation in a wilderness by its own unaided
efforts. The three main points of interest in that connection
were the abandonment of the common-stock theory, the growth
of trade, and the buying out of the interest of the capitalists,
which latter transaction foreshadowed the transfer to America
of the Massachusetts charter.</p>

<p class='c001'>The theory of a common-stock as a necessity for the profitable
operation of colonies was the accepted one of the day, in
spite of repeated failures due to human nature. That failure
had been as evident in Plymouth as elsewhere. Young unmarried
men objected to having the fruits of their toil go to
support other men's wives and children. Married men disliked
having their wives sew, cook, and wash for the others.
Hard-working men thought it unfair that they should support
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>the more idle or incapable. The older men, or those of the
better class, declined to work for the younger or meaner. The
pinch of hunger, in 1623, finally decided the colonists to set
aside their agreement, in the interests of the capitalists as
well as their own, in the one particular of raising food. The
immediate result was a greatly increased production, so that
many had a surplus and trading began among themselves, with
corn as currency. The following year, one acre of land was
confirmed to each individual in severalty.<a id='r257'></a><a href='#f257' class='c014'><sup>[257]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>There was, however, no surplus of food for export, and lumber
and beaver were the only available commodities.<a id='r258'></a><a href='#f258' class='c014'><sup>[258]</sup></a> But the
site that had been chosen for the colony was in a poor location
for the Indian trade, which required access to the interior
along some waterway; and the Pilgrims were therefore
forced to resort to coasting voyages for their main supply
of skins.</p>

<p class='c001'>Not only had the London merchants received almost no
interest upon their investment, but it began to seem evident
to them that the principal itself was lost. Quarrels among
themselves over the character of the colonists sent out, and
mutual recriminations, completed the break-down of the company.
Finally, in December, 1624, some of them wrote to
Bradford and others that they had decided to abandon the
venture and lose what they had already expended rather than
risk any more, suggesting that the Pilgrims send over what
they could to pay special debts, amounting to £1400. Those
writing the letter also sent out, on their own account, some
cattle and various useful commodities, to be sold to the settlers
at seventy per cent advance, to cover the profits and
risks. The latter were indeed great, insurance alone, at that
time, consuming about twenty-five per cent for the round
trip;<a id='r259'></a><a href='#f259' class='c014'><sup>[259]</sup></a> and the following year, Standish, who had been sent to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>London for the purpose, could not borrow money, for the purchase
of trading goods, at less than fifty per cent. Goods and
capital they must have, however, and the profits, when made,
were correspondingly great. While Standish was in London,
Winslow made a trip to the Kennebec, in a small vessel, laden
only with a little of that surplus corn which they had raised,
and there secured seven hundred pounds weight of beaver,
besides other furs. In 1626, hearing that the trading station
at Monhegan was going out of business, Bradford and Winslow,
accompanied by Thompson from Piscataqua, went to
attend the sale, at which the Pilgrims bought goods to the
value of £400. An additional stock, amounting to £100, was
bought from the wreck of a French ship in the ill-fated Damaris
Cove, the purchases being paid for with the beaver which they
had accumulated the winter before. The following spring,
Allerton arrived from London with £200 more, which he had
succeeded in raising at thirty per cent; so that their capital
was now ample.<a id='r260'></a><a href='#f260' class='c014'><sup>[260]</sup></a> The greatest advance which they made in
their trade with the Indians, however, was due to the friendly
Dutch, who sold them some wampum, and taught them its
great value in dealing with the savages. This appearance of
the ubiquitous Dutch, helping a struggling colony to achieve
economic strength by valuable advice or yet more valuable
trading in needed goods, was a frequent one in the early seventeenth
century, and in all quarters of the globe. The Pilgrims
at Plymouth, the French at St. Christophers, and innumerable
other little settlements on secluded bays or on lonely islands,
owed their prosperity or preservation to the timely arrival of
a “Dutch trading captain.” It would be interesting to trace
how many little bands of people, abandoned by their own
companies or governments, were thus nursed into strength
by the Holland traders, who sought them out, and knew
their needs.<a id='r261'></a><a href='#f261' class='c014'><sup>[261]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Assured now of sufficient food, and with the Indian trade
well established, the settlers felt that their position in these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>respects was secure. There were, however, two matters which
gave them cause for anxiety. One was the interference by
outsiders with their trade on the Kennebec, and the other was
their ill-defined situation in regard to the Adventurers in London.
In spite of the abandonment of the enterprise by the
latter, their claims would continue in existence unless legally
extinguished; and it was essential for the settlers to come to
some agreement with them, in order that their property and
goods should not be liable to seizure in the future. Negotiations,
begun by Allerton in 1626, were completed by him on
a second trip the year after, when he not only secured a patent
for a definite tract on the Kennebec from the Council for New
England, but consummated the deal with the Adventurers by
which all claims of every description were to be canceled by
the payment to them of £1800, in annual instalments of £200
each. The payment of this sum, together with £600 of additional
debt, was undertaken by Bradford, Brewster, Standish,
and Winslow, with four others in the colony and four friends in
England, in exchange for a monopoly of the colony's trade
for six years.<a id='r262'></a><a href='#f262' class='c014'><sup>[262]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>By their purchase of all the Adventurers' interest, the Pilgrims
had thus practically eliminated the proprietary elements
that had existed in their organization, and the settlement
became what, for all practical purposes, it had been from
the start—a corporate colony.<a id='r263'></a><a href='#f263' class='c014'><sup>[263]</sup></a> A new patent for Plymouth,
granted them in 1630, in the name of Bradford and certain
associates, assigned them a definite territory, which the earlier
ones had not done, and a confirmation of the Kennebec holdings
also straightened out boundary matters there. Their title-deeds,
therefore, were now secure. Their powers of government,
however, continued to rest solely upon the compact
signed in the cabin of the Mayflower ten years before; for,
in spite of their efforts, they were never able to obtain a royal
charter with privileges similar to those enjoyed by Massachusetts.
But in four of the most important elements in that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>larger migration,—the bringing of families to form permanent
homes, the peculiar form of church government, the individual
ownership of freely acquired land, and the severing of
business and legal relations with any company in England,—the
Massachusetts leaders but followed the ways laid out by
the simple founders of Plymouth.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER VI <br> <br> NEW ENGLAND AND THE GREAT MIGRATION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>During the years that the Pilgrims had thus been struggling
to found a tiny commonwealth on an inhospitable bit of the
long American coast-line, events had been moving rapidly on
the more crowded stage of the Old World. In France, the
power of the Huguenots had been hopelessly crushed by the
fall of Rochelle in 1628; while in England, affairs were evidently
approaching a crisis, due to the incompetence of the
government of Charles, with its disgraceful military failures
abroad, and its illegal financial exactions at home. No one
was safe from the ruin of his fortune or the loss of his freedom.
The nobility and gentry, subject to the imposition of forced
loans, faced imprisonment if they refused to pay; and those
below the rank of gentleman were the unwilling hosts of a
horde of ruffians, the unpaid and frequently criminal soldiery
returned from unsuccessful foreign ventures, and billeted upon
them by the government. The laws, against Catholics were
largely suspended to please the Queen, who was of that faith,
and the prospects were daily growing darker for the Puritan
and patriot elements, both within and without the Church.
Religious toleration as an avowed governmental policy was
not, as yet, seriously considered by any considerable body of
men outside of Holland, the notable example of which country
had failed to influence England, where the control of the church
was evidently passing into the hands of Laud and his party.
The time had thus come when the King must face a united
opposition of the soundest men in the country—of those who
feared alike for their property, their liberty, and their religion.</p>

<p class='c001'>The formation of the Puritan party, drawing into its fold
men animated by any or all of these motives, in varying proportions,
coincided with the beginning of the great increase in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>emigration to Massachusetts, which was to carry twenty
thousand persons to the shores of New England between 1630
and 1640. But if attention is concentrated too exclusively
upon the history of the continental colonies in North America,
and, more particularly, of those in New England, the impression
is apt to be gained that this swarming out of the English
to plant in new lands was largely confined to Massachusetts
and its neighbors, and to the decade named. The conclusion
drawn from these false premises has naturally been that Puritanism,
in the New England sense, was the only successful
colonizing force. We do not wish to minimize the value of
any deeply felt religious emotion in firmly planting a group of
people in a new home. Such value was justly recognized by one
of the wisest practical colonizers of the last century,<a id='r264'></a><a href='#f264' class='c014'><sup>[264]</sup></a> who was
not himself of a religious temperament, but who, to secure the
firm establishment of his colony, would “have transplanted
the Grand Lama of Tibet with all his prayer wheels, and did
actually nibble at the Chief Rabbi.”<a id='r265'></a><a href='#f265' class='c014'><sup>[265]</sup></a> The Puritan colonies,
nevertheless, not only were far from being the only permanent
ones, but themselves were not always equally successful;
and it is well to point out that many elements, besides peculiarity
of religious belief, entered into the success of the New
England colonies, as contrasted with the conspicuous failure
of the Puritan efforts in the Caribbean.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the beginning of the increased emigration to Massachusetts,
colonizing, indeed, had ceased to be a new and untried
business. To say nothing of the numerous large and
small French, Dutch, and Spanish settlements firmly established
in the New World, and the English already planted on
the mainland, the latter nation had successfully colonized the
islands of Bermuda in 1612, St. Kitts in 1623, Barbadoes and
St. Croix in 1625, and Nevis and Barbuda three years later.
By the time John Winthrop led his band to the shores of
Massachusetts Bay, besides the five hundred Dutch in New
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>Amsterdam, ten thousand Englishmen were present, for six
months of each year, in Newfoundland, engaged in the fisheries
there; nine hundred had settled permanently in Maine and
New Hampshire; three hundred within the present limits of
Massachusetts; three thousand in Virginia; between two and
three thousand in Bermuda; and sixteen hundred in Barbadoes;
while the numbers in the other colonies are unknown.<a id='r266'></a><a href='#f266' class='c014'><sup>[266]</sup></a>
The figures are striking also for the year 1640, or slightly later,
at which date the tide is too often considered as having flowed
almost wholly toward the Puritan colonies of New England
for the preceding ten years. The number in Massachusetts at
that time had risen to fourteen thousand, in Connecticut to
two thousand, and in Rhode Island to three hundred. Maine
and New Hampshire however, contained about fifteen hundred,
Maryland the same number, Virginia nearly eight thousand,
Nevis about four thousand, St. Kitts twelve to thirteen thousand,
and Barbadoes eighteen thousand six hundred. There are
no contemporary figures for Barbuda, St. Croix, Antigua, Montserrat,
and other settlements.<a id='r267'></a><a href='#f267' class='c014'><sup>[267]</sup></a> At the end, therefore, of what
has often been considered a period of distinctly Puritan emigration,
we find that approximately only sixteen thousand
Englishmen had taken their way to the Puritan colonies, as
against forty-six thousand to the others; which latter figure,
moreover, is undoubtedly too low, owing to the lack of statistics
just noted. Nor does the above statement take into
account the thousands of Englishmen who emigrated to Ireland
during the same period, and whose motives were probably
similar to those animating the emigrants to the New World,
however different their destinations may have been. There
had, indeed, been a “great migration,” resulting in an English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>population in America and the West Indies, by 1640 or thereabout,
of over sixty-five thousand persons; but it is somewhat
misleading to apply the term solely to the stream of emigrants
bound for the Puritan colonies, who were outnumbered three
to one by those who went to settlements where religion did
not partake of the “New England way.” Although young
John Winthrop might write of his brother that it “would be
the ruine of his soule to live among such company” as formed
the colony of Barbadoes in 1629,<a id='r268'></a><a href='#f268' class='c014'><sup>[268]</sup></a> nevertheless, the population
of that island had risen to nearly nineteen thousand in another
decade, whereas that of Massachusetts had reached only fourteen
thousand.</p>

<div id='i120'  class='figcenter id005'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Streams of Emigration from England, 1620 to 1642</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>If, in addition, we recall the fact that, approximately, not
more than one in five of the adult males who went even to
Massachusetts was sufficiently in sympathy with the religious
ideas there prevalent to become a church member, though disfranchised
for not doing so, we find that in the “great migration”
the Puritan element, in the sense of New England church-membership,
amounted to only about four thousand persons
out of about sixty-five thousand. In the wider sense, indeed,
Puritanism, in its effect on legal codes and social usages, is
found present, in greater or less degree, in almost all the
colonies, island and mainland, but the influence of the form
that it took in New England was to be wholly disproportionate
upon the nation which evolved from the scattered continental
settlements.</p>

<p class='c001'>If, however, we shift from our usual point of view and, instead
of studying the English emigration of the time in the light of
the leaders who reached New England, consider the great
body of those who left the shores of England, we shall have
to account for those fourteen emigrants out of every fifteen,
who, although willing to leave their homes and all they had
held dear, yet shunned active participation in the Bible Commonwealths.
It is evident that other causes, besides the
quarrels in the Church and the tyranny of Laud, must have
been operative on a large scale, to explain the full extent of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>movement. It seems probable that the principal cause that
induced such an extraordinary number of people, from the
ranks of the lesser gentry and those below them, to make so
complete a break in their lives as was implied by leaving all
they had ever known for the uncertainties of far-off lands, was
economic. They came for the simple reason that they wanted
to better their condition. They wanted to be rid of the growing
and incalculable exactions of government. They wanted
to own land; and it was this last motive, perhaps, which
mainly had attracted those twelve thousand persons out of
sixteen thousand who swelled the population of Massachusetts
in 1640, but were not church members; for the Puritan colonies
were the only ones in which land could be owned in fee simple,
without quit-rent or lord, and in which it was freely given to
settlers.<a id='r269'></a><a href='#f269' class='c014'><sup>[269]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The local sources in England of the great migration, and the
relations of that movement to local economic conditions, have
not received adequate treatment as yet, and the subject is
somewhat obscure; but apparently it was the eastern and
southeastern counties that furnished the main supply of immigrants
for the New World. It was in these counties that
the artisans from Flanders had sought refuge, when driven
abroad by Alva, as well as the Huguenots from France. In
these counties, also, the enclosures, which were of such far-reaching
economic influence, had taken place earlier than elsewhere,
while wages there showed a lower ratio to subsistence
than in the north.<a id='r270'></a><a href='#f270' class='c014'><sup>[270]</sup></a> The special area in which the inhabitants
were most disposed to seek new homes was that around the low
country draining into the Wash; and throughout the early
seventeenth century economic and agrarian agitation was notably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>constant in that particular region,<a id='r271'></a><a href='#f271' class='c014'><sup>[271]</sup></a> the period of heaviest
emigration—that between 1630 and 1640—marking, perhaps,
its years of greatest economic readjustment and strain. The
rise in rents and land-values had, indeed, been enormous during
the preceding half-century.<a id='r272'></a><a href='#f272' class='c014'><sup>[272]</sup></a> But this agricultural prosperity
had been so closely bound up with the great expansion of the
cloth industry, that in this section it may be said to have been
wholly dependent upon it.<a id='r273'></a><a href='#f273' class='c014'><sup>[273]</sup></a> From 1625 to 1630, however, the
business of the clothiers suffered a very severe decline, which
continued for some years, and the effects of which were very
marked in the agricultural industries as well.<a id='r274'></a><a href='#f274' class='c014'><sup>[274]</sup></a> In Norwich,
for example, the Mayor and Aldermen complained that, owing
to the dearth of food, and to the great increase of unemployment
due to bad trade conditions, the amount necessary for
poor relief had to be doubled.<a id='r275'></a><a href='#f275' class='c014'><sup>[275]</sup></a> Moreover, as is always the
case in periods of great economic alteration, the change had
not affected all classes in the community alike. The yeomanry,
who were less influenced by the rapidly rising scale of
living, and so could save a much larger proportion of their
increased gains from the high agricultural prices, were improving
their position at the expense of the gentry.<a id='r276'></a><a href='#f276' class='c014'><sup>[276]</sup></a> Enterprising
traders, in the cloth and other industries, who had
acquired fortunes, but who naturally were not of the old
families, were pushing in and buying country estates, and,
like all <span lang="fr"><i>nouveaux riches</i></span>, were asserting their new and unaccustomed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>position by raising the scale of living.<a id='r277'></a><a href='#f277' class='c014'><sup>[277]</sup></a> Many of the
gentry, on the other hand, unable to adjust themselves to the
new economic conditions or to take advantage of them, and
yet unwilling to give up their comparative position in the
county, found themselves “overtaken,” as a contemporary
writer says, “with too well meaning and good nature,” and so
were “inforced sometimes to suffer a revolution” in their
domestic affairs.<a id='r278'></a><a href='#f278' class='c014'><sup>[278]</sup></a> About the years of the emigration, however,
there seem to have been financial difficulties and economic
unrest among all the classes, due to the immediate crisis in
the cloth trade, as well as to the more general conditions of the
time.</p>

<p class='c001'>The district in which these economic changes were at work
was also the one in which Puritanism had taken its strongest
hold, and the leaders both of the Puritan movement at home
and of colonization abroad “formed a veritable clan, intimately
bound together by ties of blood, marriage, and neighborhood,
acting together in all that concerned colonization on the one
hand and autocratic rule on the other.”<a id='r279'></a><a href='#f279' class='c014'><sup>[279]</sup></a> We have already
seen, in an earlier chapter, how the trading companies had
brought into working contact the great nobles, city merchants,
and country gentlemen, and accustomed them to act together
as, perhaps, nothing else could have done, thus paving the way
for the formation of the Puritan party.</p>

<p class='c001'>In addition to this foundation, the leaders were united by
ties based upon social and blood-relationship, many of which
were of great importance in the affairs of both Old and New
England. Among many such, we may note that John Endicott
was a parishioner of the Reverend John White, who was
interested in the Cape Ann fishing company with John Humphrey.
Humphrey, in turn, was a brother-in-law of the Earl
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>of Lincoln, one of the most earnest of the Puritan peers, and
son-in-law of Viscount Say and Sele. Lincoln's other brothers-in-law
were Isaac Johnson and John Gorges, the latter a son
of Sir Ferdinando. Lincoln's steward, Thomas Dudley, was
a parishioner of John Cotton. The Earl of Holland was a
brother of the Earl of Warwick, who was the leader of the
Puritans. The latter's interests in Parliament were attended
to by Lord Brooke, while his man of business was Sir Nathaniel
Rich. The Riches and the Barringtons were neighbors and
close friends. Lady Joan Barrington, who was a correspondent
of many of the New England emigrants, was an aunt of John
Hampden and Oliver Cromwell, and Roger Williams at one
time applied for the hand of her niece. Many of these were
deeply interested in the attempt to found a Puritan colony
in the Caribbean, as were also Gregory Gawsell, John Gurdon,
and Sir Edward Moundeford, who were all three country
neighbors and intimate friends of John Winthrop and his
family circle.<a id='r280'></a><a href='#f280' class='c014'><sup>[280]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>At the time that our story has now reached, there were two
projects for Puritan settlement in which members of this clan
were particularly interested, that of the island of Old Providence
in the Caribbean Sea, and that of the remnants of
the Cape Ann fishing attempt, which was mentioned in the
preceding chapter. The latter somewhat ill-judged effort, in
1623, to combine as a single enterprise an agricultural colony
on land and a fishing business at sea, had been abandoned
two years later, with a loss of £3000.<a id='r281'></a><a href='#f281' class='c014'><sup>[281]</sup></a> Most of the men had
been withdrawn, but Roger Conant, with a few others, decided
to remain in America, transferring their homes to the location
of what was in a few years to be known as Salem. Thinking
that something might still be saved from the wreck, a few of
the Adventurers in England plucked up courage, and having
interested fresh capitalists, including Thomas Dudley, secured
the services of John Endicott as local governor, and, in 1628,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>were granted a patent from the Council for New England.<a id='r282'></a><a href='#f282' class='c014'><sup>[282]</sup></a>
The Puritan character of the new undertaking would be sufficiently
evidenced by the names of White and his parishioner
Endicott, Humphrey, and Dudley, did we not know also that
the Earl of Warwick, who seven years before had secured the
patent for the Pilgrims, now acted in obtaining that for the
New England Company.<a id='r283'></a><a href='#f283' class='c014'><sup>[283]</sup></a> Sir Ferdinando Gorges, to whom
Warwick applied, gave his consent, provided that the new
patent should not be prejudicial to the interests of his son
Robert, and distinctly stated that the new colony was to
found a place of refuge for Puritans.<a id='r284'></a><a href='#f284' class='c014'><sup>[284]</sup></a> The grant, which extended
from three miles north of the River Merrimac to three
miles south of the Charles, conflicted with that bestowed on
Gorges and Mason in 1622, as well as with that of Robert
Gorges of similar date. As the same limits were confirmed
in the royal charter to the Company of Massachusetts Bay
in 1629, the seeds of future discord were sown in these conflicting
titles.<a id='r285'></a><a href='#f285' class='c014'><sup>[285]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Endicott was at once dispatched, with a few followers, to
take possession, and to prepare the way for a larger body to
be sent in the succeeding year. The little band, with which
he arrived in September, 1628, together with the old settlers
already on the spot, made up a company of only fifty or sixty
people, most of whom seem to have done little but “rub out
the winter's cold by the Fire-side,” “turning down many a
drop of the Bottell, and burning Tobacco with all the ease
they could,” while they discussed the progress they would
make in the summer.<a id='r286'></a><a href='#f286' class='c014'><sup>[286]</sup></a> There was, however, much sickness
among them, which may have accounted in part for their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>close hearth-keeping. From what we know of Endicott's
harsh manners and lack of wisdom in dealing with delicate
situations, it may be assumed that his superseding of Conant
in the office of local governor was not made more palatable
by any grace in his announcement of the fact; and, in any case,
ill-feeling developed between the old and new planters. This,
however, was smoothed over by Conant's own tact, and affairs
were adjusted “so meum and tuum that divide the world,
should not disturb the peace of good Christians.”<a id='r287'></a><a href='#f287' class='c014'><sup>[287]</sup></a> Morton,
owing to his unsympathetic neighbors, the Pilgrims, was temporarily
in England, and so absent from his crew at Merry
Mount; but Endicott promptly visited that very un-Puritan
and somewhat dangerous settlement, and having hewn down
the offending May-pole, “admonished them to look ther should
be better walking.”<a id='r288'></a><a href='#f288' class='c014'><sup>[288]</sup></a> It is possible that, before winter set in,
preparations may have been made for a second settlement at
Charlestown to forestall the claims of Oldham in that locality.<a id='r289'></a><a href='#f289' class='c014'><sup>[289]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Endicott's whole mission at this time, indeed, seems to have
been merely to prepare the way for others; and in the following
year, six ships were dispatched, carrying over four hundred
people, with cattle and additional supplies.<a id='r290'></a><a href='#f290' class='c014'><sup>[290]</sup></a> Four clergymen,
including Skelton and Higginson, were also sent, for the
spiritual welfare of the colony, and the conversion of the Indians,
which latter object, at this stage of the enterprise, was
officially declared to be the main end of the plantation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Meanwhile, the number of those in England interested in
the venture continued to grow, and a royal charter, under the
broad seal, was granted March 4, 1629, in the names of Sir
Henry Rosewell, Sir John Younge, Thomas Southcott, John
Humphrey, John Endicott, and their associates, the total
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>membership of the company being about one hundred and
ten.<a id='r291'></a><a href='#f291' class='c014'><sup>[291]</sup></a> The grant followed somewhat closely that received by
the Virginia Company in 1609, the patentees being joint proprietors
of the plantation, with rights of ownership and
government similar to those enjoyed by the earlier London
Company. A General Court, to meet quarterly, was provided
for, and annually, at the Easter session, this court was to elect
a governor, deputy governor and a board of assistants, consisting
of eighteen members. By an important clause, six
of the latter, together with the governor or his deputy, constituted
a quorum, and were therefore required to be present
at the sittings of the court. The General Court, consisting
of the members of the Company, known as freemen, was also
given the power to add to its number, and to make such
necessary laws and ordinances as should not be repugnant
to the laws of England. The first governor was Mathew
Cradock, with Thomas Goffe as deputy, the Assistants including
Sir Richard Saltonstall, Isaac Johnson, John Humphrey,
John Endicott, Increase Nowell, Theophilus Eaton,
and John Browne. It was this charter of a proprietary company,
skillfully interpreted to fit the needs of the case, and
constantly violated as to its terms, which formed the basis
of the commonwealth government of Massachusetts for over
half a century.</p>

<p class='c001'>The company, so organized, proceeded to arrange for a local
government in Massachusetts, confirming Endicott as governor,
and associating with him a council of thirteen. This was to
include the three clergymen then there, the two Brownes, and
two of the old planters, if the latter group should desire such
representation. Efforts were made to conserve as equitably
as possible the rights of those former settlers, and other instructions
for the conduct of the company's affairs were forwarded
to Endicott a few weeks after the grant of the charter.<a id='r292'></a><a href='#f292' class='c014'><sup>[292]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>Writing home, at the end of the first summer, Higginson stated
that, on their arrival, they had found “aboute a half score
houses, and a fair house newly built for the Governor,” and
that, including the newcomers and old settlers, about three
hundred people were planted in the colony, of whom two
thirds were at Salem and the remainder at Charlestown.<a id='r293'></a><a href='#f293' class='c014'><sup>[293]</sup></a>
“But that which is our greatest comfort and means of defence
above all others,” he continued, “is that we have here the
true religion and holy ordinances of Almighty God taught
amongst us. Thanks be to God, we have here plenty of

<p class='c001'>As we noted in an earlier chapter, many writers have insisted
greatly upon the rigid distinction between the Pilgrims, as
Separatists, and the Puritans, as mere Nonconformists. Not
only, however, were the members of the several communities
by no means agreed as to what constituted Separatism and
Nonconformity, but, in the American wilderness, such distinctions
rapidly ceased to have any but a disputatious value,
with, at intervals, political reverberations in England. The
Pilgrims, at the time of their emigration from Holland, may
have been strict Separatists or on the way to becoming mere
non-Separatist Independent Puritans;<a id='r294'></a><a href='#f294' class='c014'><sup>[294]</sup></a> and the leaders of
the churches of Massachusetts for many years denied any
Separatism on their own part or that of the Pilgrims. John
Cotton wrote categorically, in 1647, that “for New England
there is no such church of the Separation at al that I know
of.”<a id='r295'></a><a href='#f295' class='c014'><sup>[295]</sup></a> On the other hand, many, of all shades of religious
belief, refused to acknowledge this view of the matter. They
found it impossible to answer Roger Williams's query as to
“what is that which Mr. Cotton and so many hundreths fearing
God in New England walk in, but a way of separation?”<a id='r296'></a><a href='#f296' class='c014'><sup>[296]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>Indeed, in view of the open and patent facts, the only possible
answer was the casuistical one of Cotton and the other leaders,
that they had separated, “not from the Churches in Old England,
as no Churches, but from some corruptions found in
them.”<a id='r297'></a><a href='#f297' class='c014'><sup>[297]</sup></a> As these corruptions were held to include the polity
and ritual of the English Church, and as members of the New
England churches, though they might listen to its preaching,
were not allowed to be in communion with it, and as no Church
of England services were permitted on New England soil, the
point as to whether or not the New England Puritans were
Separatists is a mere matter of terms. It depends upon the
question how far a minority of any organization, social, political,
or religious, can go in denying the validity of its ideas, in refusing
to conform to its practices, and in not allowing them to
be used, and still consider themselves as being in the organization.
Opinions will always differ, and it is as impossible to
decide to-day whether the Puritans became Separatists as it
was for themselves and their critics to decide at the time.</p>

<p class='c001'>The question of terms is not especially important, but the
question of polity, as it was developed in the little church at
Salem, is immensely so, for it undoubtedly gave a very great impetus
to the growth of Congregationalism in Massachusetts,
and, indeed, has been called “the chief point of departure in
the ecclesiastical history of New England,” which was so inextricably
interwoven with its political history. In no other
part of the country has a more distinct and persistent type of
thought and character been developed than in that section;
and in this regard we have already noted the important influences
of the geographic environment. But the impress of
its institutional life was no less effective upon the minds of
its people. It was not Puritanism alone that developed the
type; for, we repeat, the Puritan strain may be traced in the
legislation and social life of many of the English settlements,
and the Puritanism of any individual to-day may derive quite
as directly from an ancestral Bermudian, Georgian, Jamaican
Commonwealth man, Carolinian Scotch Covenanter, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>Pennsylvanian Ulsterite, as from a settler in Salem or Plymouth.
But wherever we find Congregationalism, town government,
and the village school, we may trace the triple influence
straight to New England.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is impossible to say what may have been the precise ideas
as to church government held by the groups which emigrated
with Endicott and in the following year, but the evidence
seems clear that, at least as far as Endicott was concerned,
they were identical with those of the Pilgrims, or were unconsciously
derived from them after arrival. Dr. Fuller, who
visited Salem during the sickness of the first winter, was not
only a physician but a deacon of the Plymouth church. With
him Endicott discussed the question of church polity, and, as
a result, wrote to Governor Bradford that “I am by him satisfied
touching your judgments of the outward forme of Gods
worshipe. It is, as farr as I can gather, no other than is
warranted by the evidence of truth, and the same which I
have proffessed and maintained ever since the Lord in mercie
revealed him selfe unto me.”<a id='r298'></a><a href='#f298' class='c014'><sup>[298]</sup></a> A few weeks later, after the
arrival of Skelton and Higginson, the Salem church was organized,
with the former as pastor, and the latter as teacher,
the members being united by a church covenant, which became
one of the essential features of the New England church system.<a id='r299'></a><a href='#f299' class='c014'><sup>[299]</sup></a>
In that system, every local church was independent,
choosing and ordaining its own pastor, teachers, and ruling
elders, and was composed of such Christians only as could
satisfy the other church members of their converted state.<a id='r300'></a><a href='#f300' class='c014'><sup>[300]</sup></a>
“The stones that were to be laid in Solomon's temple,” wrote
Cotton, with characteristic far-fetched use of Old Testament
texts, “were squared and made ready before they were laid
in the building ... and, wherefore so, if not to hold forth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>that no members were to be received into the Church of Christ,
but such as were rough-hewn, and squared, and fitted to lie
close and levell to Christ and to his members?”<a id='r301'></a><a href='#f301' class='c014'><sup>[301]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Although the church government was democratic in form, and
thus of influence in fostering democratic beliefs as to government
in general, it must be remembered that at probably no
period during the life of the charter, did the number of church
members include more than a very distinct minority of the
population. Lechford's statement, that three quarters of the
people were outside the pale of the church in 1640, seems
borne out by other testimony, and this proportion appears
not to have been greatly changed till near the end of the century.<a id='r302'></a><a href='#f302' class='c014'><sup>[302]</sup></a>
The influence of this democratic form of church organization,
however, was clearly foreseen by King James in his
dictum, “No bishop, no king”; and of even greater effect in
its logical political consequence was the employment of the
covenant. In defending its use in the church, Cotton, in the
volume already quoted, was forced onto broader ground. “It
is evident,” he wrote, “by the light of nature, that all civill
Relations are founded in Covenant. For, to passe by naturall
Relations between Parents and Children, and violent Relations
between Conquerors and Captives; there is no other way
given wherby a people (sui Juris) free from naturall and compulsory
engagements, can be united or combined together
into one visible body.”<a id='r303'></a><a href='#f303' class='c014'><sup>[303]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It is difficult to overestimate the influence which, in time,
these two ideas, of a democratic church polity and a voluntary
covenant as the only basis for a civil government, would come
to exert upon those holding them; but for the moment, the
result was the forcible expulsion from the community of two
members who did not hold them. John and Samuel Browne,
both men of good estate, the one a merchant and the other a
lawyer, and both original patentees of the Company, had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>left England for Salem in the spring of 1629, with high recommendation
to Endicott from the Company at home, as men
much trusted and respected.<a id='r304'></a><a href='#f304' class='c014'><sup>[304]</sup></a> When the Salem church was
organized, the two brothers, who were both on the council,
objected, accusing the ministers of having become Separatists,
which they denied. As the Brownes refused to give up the
use of the prayer-book, and held private services with their
followers, Endicott, either from personal feeling or from a real
fear that the trouble would disrupt the colony, took a strong
stand, and shipped them back to England.<a id='r305'></a><a href='#f305' class='c014'><sup>[305]</sup></a> There is no contemporary
account of the details, and it is therefore as unwise,
perhaps, to condemn Endicott, as it is unjustifiable to speak
of the Brownes as “anarchical,” or, with an odd lack of humor,
as “Schismatical.”<a id='r306'></a><a href='#f306' class='c014'><sup>[306]</sup></a> Endicott was mildly censured by
the Company in England, who wrote that they conceived that
“it is possible some undigested councells have too sudainely
bin put in execution, wch may have ill construccion with the
state heere;” while the ministers were asked to clear themselves
if innocent, or else to look back upon their “miscarriage
wth repentance.” In time the Brownes seem to have been
settled with satisfactorily on a cash basis.<a id='r307'></a><a href='#f307' class='c014'><sup>[307]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>While progress was thus being made in the establishment
of the Massachusetts Bay colony, another project for a Puritan
settlement was rapidly taking form. After the dissolution of
the Virginia Company, the quarrel between the Sandys and
Warwick factions was continued in the courts of the Somers
Islands, or Bermuda Company, and its affairs were going
from bad to worse, largely owing to the frequent changes in
the person of the governor as the two factions succeeded each
other in power at home. In April, 1629, Sir Nathaniel Rich
received a long letter from Governor Bell, in regard to various
matters, in the course of which he described two islands lying
in the Caribbean, in either of which he thought one year would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>“be more profitable than seven years here,” and placed the
disposition of both islands in Warwick's hands.<a id='r308'></a><a href='#f308' class='c014'><sup>[308]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It was a momentous time. Hardly more than a few days
before, Parliament had been angrily dissolved by the King,
not to meet again for eleven years. Eliot, Selden, and seven
other of the popular leaders had been committed to the Tower.
In every direction, Puritans of distinction, and even such
lesser men as John Humphrey and John Winthrop, were made
to feel the hostility of the court. The recent successful colonization
of St. Kitts and Barbadoes by the Earls of Carlisle and
Marlborough, both members of the court party, and hostile
to the Warwicks and Riches, combined with the flattering
report of the new-found islands by Bell, induced Warwick,
whose affairs had not been going well, to make an immediate
counter-move. With Rich, Gawsell, and others, he provided
£2000, and dispatched two ships for the Caribbean under
letters of marque. They arrived at Providence about Christmas,
the company beginning to make ready for the larger body
which was to arrive in the spring, precisely as Endicott had done
at Salem. “The aim and desire above all things,” wrote the
promoters of the enterprise, “is to plant the true and sincere
Religion and worship of God, which in the Christian world
is now very much opposed.” At first, the utmost secrecy was
maintained as to the real aims of Warwick and his associates;
and it was only in December of the following year, after the
main body of the colonists had already been planted, that
letters-patent for the islands were procured from the King.<a id='r309'></a><a href='#f309' class='c014'><sup>[309]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>There can be no doubt, however, that the matter was well
known to Winthrop and others of those who were contemplating
emigration in the summer of 1629. Not only was Gawsell
a neighbor and friend of Winthrop, but all steps taken by the
Massachusetts group seem to have been talked over with
Warwick and Rich.<a id='r310'></a><a href='#f310' class='c014'><sup>[310]</sup></a> John Winthrop, now in his forty-third
year, who was living the life of a country squire at Groton, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>Suffolk, and was a small office-holder under government, had
been anxiously watching the course of affairs. Of a sensitive
and deeply religious nature, strongly attached to the Puritan
cause, he could not but regard the future with the greatest
anxiety. “The Lord hath admonished, threatened, corrected
and astonished us,” he wrote to his wife in May, 1629, “yet
we growe worse and worse, so as his spirit will not allwayes
strive with us, he must needs give waye to his fury at last....
We sawe this, and humbled not ourselves, to turne from
our evill wayes, but have provoked him more than all the
nations rounde about us: therefore he is turninge the cuppe
toward us also, and because we are the last, our portion must
be, to drinke the verye dreggs which remaine. My dear wife,
I am veryly persuaded, God will bringe some heavye Affliction
upon this lande, and that speedylye.”<a id='r311'></a><a href='#f311' class='c014'><sup>[311]</sup></a> In addition to his
fear that all hope of civil, as well as of even a moderate degree
of religious, liberty was rapidly fading, Winthrop was also
much troubled by the prospects for his personal social and
financial position. A few months earlier, he had written to
his son Henry, at that time a settler in Barbadoes, that he
then owed more than he was able to pay without selling his
land; and throughout all his letters and papers of the period
runs the same strain of anxiety over money matters.<a id='r312'></a><a href='#f312' class='c014'><sup>[312]</sup></a> Although
possessed of a modest estate, which, when subsequently
sold, realized £4200,<a id='r313'></a><a href='#f313' class='c014'><sup>[313]</sup></a> the demands of a large family, and the
increased cost of living, were more than he could meet. In
June, he was, in addition, deprived of his office under the
Master of the Wards, and wrote to his wife that “where we
shall spende the rest of or short tyme I knowe not: the Lorde,
I trust, will direct us in mercye.”<a id='r314'></a><a href='#f314' class='c014'><sup>[314]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>With the discussion then going on in Puritan circles as to
Endicott's settlement at Salem, and with his neighbors actively
interested in the colony at Providence, it was natural that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>Winthrop should seriously consider the thought of emigrating.
Just at this time, a paper consisting of arguments for and
against settling a plantation in New England was being circulated
among the group of Puritans mentioned earlier in
this chapter. The reasons given in favor of it were mainly religious
and economic. The first dwelt upon the glory of opposing
Anti-Christ, in the form of the French Jesuits in Canada,
and of raising “a particular church” in New England,
while the second referred to the supposed surplus population
at home, and to the standard and cost of living which had
“growne to that height of intemperance in all excesse of Riott,
as noe mans estate allmost will suffice to keepe saile with his
aequalls.”<a id='r315'></a><a href='#f315' class='c014'><sup>[315]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The document, which has come down to us in at least four
different forms, was possibly drafted by Winthrop himself,
though the evidence is only inferential, and it has also been
attributed to the Reverend John White and others.<a id='r316'></a><a href='#f316' class='c014'><sup>[316]</sup></a> It is
interesting to note that John Hampden wrote to Sir John
Eliot, then in prison, for a copy of it.<a id='r317'></a><a href='#f317' class='c014'><sup>[317]</sup></a> Whether or not Winthrop
was the author, several copies, one of them indorsed
“May, 1629,” contain memoranda of “Particular considerations
in the case of J. W.,” in which he wrote that the success
of the plan had come to depend upon him, for “the chiefe
supporters (uppon whom the rest depends) will not stirr wthout
him,” and that his wife and children are in favor of it. “His
meanes,” moreover, he wrote, “heer are so shortened (now
3 of his sonnes being com to age have drawen awaie the one
half of his estate) as he shall not be able to continue in that
place and imployment where he now iss, his ordinary charg
being still as great almost as when his meanes was double”;
and that “if he lett pass this opportunitie, That talent wch
God hath bestowed uppon him for publicke service is like to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>be buried.”<a id='r318'></a><a href='#f318' class='c014'><sup>[318]</sup></a> “With what comfort can I live,” he added in
one version, “wth 7 or 8 servts in that place and condition
where for many years I have spent 3: or 400 li yearly and
maintained a greater chardge?”<a id='r319'></a><a href='#f319' class='c014'><sup>[319]</sup></a> The prospects in England,
for his wife and children, lay heavily on his mind. “For my
care of thee and thine,” he wrote to the former, after the die
was cast, “I will say nothing. The Lord knows my heart,
that it was one great motive to draw me into this course.”<a id='r320'></a><a href='#f320' class='c014'><sup>[320]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>His judgment regarding the ending of the opportunity for
a public career for such as himself in England was obviously
wrong, as events developed there. The England which retained
a Pym, a Hampden, an Eliot, and a Cromwell, may
well have offered scope for the talents of a Winthrop. As our
eyes are usually fastened on this side of the water, we are apt
to think of the Pilgrims, Puritans, and other immigrants as
starting their careers by coming here. We rarely consider
them in the light of leaving behind them other possible careers
in England. It is no disparagement of the courage with which
they faced the wilderness, to think of them, for a moment, as
Englishmen, abandoning their place in the struggle at home,
and to consider the type of mind which thus preferred to
exchange the simplifications of unpeopled America for the
complexities of the situation in England. Is it, perhaps, altogether
fanciful, to attribute, in slight part, that deeply ingrained
feeling of Americans, that they wish to have nothing
to do with the problems of the world at large, to this choice
of the founders in abandoning their place in the struggles of
Europe for a more untrammeled career on a small provincial
stage?</p>

<p class='c001'>Winthrop's reasons have been thus dwelt upon, because, in
the motives given by him who was the purest, gentlest, and
broadest-minded of all who were to guide the destinies of the
Bay Colony, we presumably find the highest of those which
animated any of the men who sought its shores. As we descend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>the scale of character, the religious incentives narrow and disappear,
as does also the desire for honorable public service,
and the economic factor alone remains.</p>

<p class='c001'>In July, a few weeks after Winthrop lost his office, Isaac
Johnson, a brother-in-law of the Earl of Lincoln, wrote to
Emanuel Downing, a brother-in-law of Winthrop, asking them
to meet at Sempringham, the Earl's seat in Lincolnshire,
whither they both went on the 28th.<a id='r321'></a><a href='#f321' class='c014'><sup>[321]</sup></a> There they undoubtedly
met Dudley, Johnson, Humphrey, and others of that family
and social group. All those gathered there, so far as we know,
were keenly interested in the project for Massachusetts. As
they were also in close touch with Warwick, Rich, and others
of those who were just at the moment planning to send out the
colony to Providence in September, it is probable that both
places were considered, and Warwick continued for years to
urge Winthrop and his group to move to the southern colony.
The decision, however, was in favor of Massachusetts; and,
a few weeks later, on August 26, Saltonstall, Dudley, Johnson,
Humphrey, Winthrop, and seven others, signed an agreement
by which they bound themselves to be ready, with their families
and goods, by the first of the following March, to embark for
New England, and to settle there permanently.<a id='r322'></a><a href='#f322' class='c014'><sup>[322]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>There was one clause in the agreement, of incalculable importance.
“Provided always,” so it read, “that before the
last of September next, the whole Government, together with
the patent for the said plantation, be first, by an order of
court, legally transferred and established to remain with us
and others which shall inhabit upon the said Plantation.”<a id='r323'></a><a href='#f323' class='c014'><sup>[323]</sup></a>
Possibly as a result of consultation with the Cambridge signers,
Governor Cradock, at a meeting of the court of the Company
a month earlier, had read certain propositions, “conceived
by himself,” which anticipated this condition. They seem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>to have struck those present as serious and novel, and of such
importance in their possible consequences as to call for deferred
consideration in great secrecy. The matter was brought
up at a number of successive meetings, and it was only after
much debate, objections on the part of many, and the taking
of legal advice, that the court finally voted that the charter
and government might be removed to America.<a id='r324'></a><a href='#f324' class='c014'><sup>[324]</sup></a> By such
transfer, and the use made of the charter in New England,
what was intended to be a mere trading company, similar
to those which had preceded it, became transformed into a
self-governing commonwealth, whose rulers treated the charter
as if it were the constitution of an independent state. Such an
interpretation could not legally be carried beyond a certain
point, and the attempt was bound to break down under the
strain.</p>

<p class='c001'>The step, in its far-reaching consequences, was one of the
most important events in the development of the British
colonies, but its story remains a mystery. It was a completely
new departure, but may have been suggested to the leaders
by the act of the Pilgrims in buying out their English partners
and thus in effect, though without any legal authority, constituting
themselves a self-governing community. There has
been much discussion as to whether the absence in the original
charter of any words indicating that the corporation was to
remain in England was due to accident or design. It is impossible
to prove the point either way, for Winthrop's statement,
of somewhat uncertain application and written many
years later, does not seem conclusive against the other facts
and probabilities.<a id='r325'></a><a href='#f325' class='c014'><sup>[325]</sup></a> The proceedings at the meetings of the
court show clearly, at least, that many of the most active
patentees had had no inkling of any such conscious alteration
of the document at the time of issue, nor does it seem
likely that Charles I would have knowingly consented. If the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>charter were intentionally so worded as to create “the Adventurers
a Corporation upon the Place,”<a id='r326'></a><a href='#f326' class='c014'><sup>[326]</sup></a> for the purpose the
wording was later made to serve, then such of the leaders as
arranged the matter consciously hoodwinked both the government
and many of their own associates.</p>

<p class='c001'>At length, however, the consent of the patentees was obtained,
after their counsel had approved the legality of the
step; and in October, in contemplation of the removal of the
government to America, Winthrop was elected Governor, and
Humphrey, Deputy, in place of those who were to remain
behind.<a id='r327'></a><a href='#f327' class='c014'><sup>[327]</sup></a> Eight months later, in the early summer of 1630,
Winthrop and a band of between nine hundred and a thousand
immigrants landed in America, and settled what were later
known as the towns of Charlestown, Boston, Medford, Watertown,
Roxbury, Lynn, and Dorchester.<a id='r328'></a><a href='#f328' class='c014'><sup>[328]</sup></a> Eighty of the inhabitants
already planted at Salem under Endicott had died
during the winter, and of those who formed the present settlements,
about two hundred succumbed between the time of
leaving England and the end of December, including Johnson,
his wife the Lady Arbella, the Reverend Mr. Higginson, and
other important members of the colony.<a id='r329'></a><a href='#f329' class='c014'><sup>[329]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The settlers, apparently, did not have time to house themselves
properly before winter came on, and many, particularly
of the poor, had to face the icy winds of a New England
January with no better shelter than a canvas tent.<a id='r330'></a><a href='#f330' class='c014'><sup>[330]</sup></a> Provisions,
even in England, were exceedingly scarce and dear
that year, partly, some claimed, because of the large quantities
taken out by emigrants to New England and the other plantations.<a id='r331'></a><a href='#f331' class='c014'><sup>[331]</sup></a>
Massachusetts had evidently not received her share,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>if such had been the case, and famine soon faced the settlers,
who were forced to live partly on mussels and acorns.<a id='r332'></a><a href='#f332' class='c014'><sup>[332]</sup></a> Even
upon their arrival in the summer, food had been so scarce that
they had been forced to give their liberty to a hundred and
eighty servants, entailing a loss of between three and four
hundred pounds.<a id='r333'></a><a href='#f333' class='c014'><sup>[333]</sup></a> The cold, which had held off until December
24, suddenly came on in extreme severity, and “such a
Christmas eve they had never seen before.” The contrast
with the Christmas Day which the Warwick settlers were
passing at Providence, in the Caribbean, was complete; and
Humphrey and Downing, who were in frequent conference with
the earl and with Rich, kept writing to advise Winthrop to
move the colony farther south, if only to the Hudson River.<a id='r334'></a><a href='#f334' class='c014'><sup>[334]</sup></a>
At a critical moment, the ship Lion, which Winthrop had had
the foresight to send at once to England for provisions, arrived
with a new supply; but so deep was the discouragement, that
many returned in her to the old home, never to come back.
Others, however, were of sterner stuff, and took passage in
the same boat to fetch their families.<a id='r335'></a><a href='#f335' class='c014'><sup>[335]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>At last the winter passed, and with the summer came renewed
hope. The public business had been temporarily
managed by the Assistants only, and the first General Court
was not held until October. At that session the charter was
violated in an important point, in that the freemen relinquished
their right to elect the governor and the deputy. Thereafter,
it was ruled, these were to be elected by the Assistants only,
with whom they were to have the power of making laws and
appointing officers.<a id='r336'></a><a href='#f336' class='c014'><sup>[336]</sup></a> The extent of this limitation of the
right of election, which was revoked, however, at the next
General Court, is evident from the fact that in March, in
contemplation of the probability of there being less than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>nine Assistants left in the colony, it was agreed that seven
should constitute a court. In fact, the charter was continually
violated in that regard, as the number of Assistants, for over
fifty years, was never more than about one half of the required
eighteen.<a id='r337'></a><a href='#f337' class='c014'><sup>[337]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Assistants, into whose hands the control of the government
now passed, were probably a majority of the entire
voting population of the colony. According to the terms of
the charter only members of the Company, or the so-called
freemen, had the right to vote at its meetings. After the
“sea-change” which was presumed to have altered that document
into “something rich and strange” in the way of political
constitutions, those meetings became the political assemblies
of the colony, and the freemen of the Company became the
only enfranchised voters of the state. While two thousand
persons were settled in Massachusetts about the time of that
October meeting, it is probable that not more than sixteen to
twenty members of the Company had crossed the ocean, of
whom a number had returned or died.<a id='r338'></a><a href='#f338' class='c014'><sup>[338]</sup></a> If the charter were
indeed the written constitution of a state, it was unique among
such instruments in that it thus limited all political rights, in
a community of two thousand persons, to a tiny self-perpetuating
oligarchical group of not more than a dozen citizens.
Ninety-nine and one half per cent of the population was thus
unenfranchised and unrepresented, and even denied the right
of appeal to the higher authorities in England.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such was the situation, brought about with full knowledge
and intention, and as long as possible persisted in, by the
Puritan leaders. Those leaders, as we have such clear proof
in the case of the noblest of them, John Winthrop, seem to
have come to Massachusetts with three distinct and clearly
understood objects. They wished, first, to found and develop
a peculiar type of community, best expressed by the term
Bible-Commonwealth, in which the political and religious elements,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>in themselves and in their relations to one another,
should be but two aspects of the same method of so regulating
the lives of individuals as to bring them into harmony with
the expressed will of God, as interpreted by the self-appointed
rulers. Secondly, both as religious zealots, who felt that they
had come into possession of ultimate truth, and as active-minded
Englishmen, desirous of an outlet for their administrative
energies, they considered themselves as the best qualified
rulers and the appointed guardians for the community which
they had founded. Lastly, having been largely determined
by economic considerations in venturing their fortunes in the
enterprise, they looked with fear, as well as jealousy, upon any
possibility of allowing control of policy, of law and order, and
of legislation concerning person and property, to pass to others.</p>

<p class='c001'>In such a church-state, no civil question could be considered
aside from its possible religious bearings; no religious opinion
could be discussed apart from its political implications. It
was a system which could be maintained permanently only by
the most rigid denial of political free speech and religious
toleration. Fortunately, however, it contained within itself
the seeds of its own dissolution. Apart from other factors,
the church-covenant idea, brought by the Pilgrims, accepted
by Endicott, and indorsed by the three churches formed by
the Winthrop colonists, in 1630, at Dorchester, Charlestown,
and Watertown, was the seed of a democratic conception of
the state, which grew so persistently as to defy all efforts of its
own planters to destroy it. The attitude of the two most
influential Massachusetts leaders, lay and ecclesiastical, is
not a matter of inference. “Democracy,” wrote Winthrop,
after stating that there “was no such government in Israel,” is
“amongst civil nations, accounted the meanest and worst of
all forms of government.” To allow it in Massachusetts
would be “a manifest breach of the 5th. Commandment.”<a id='r339'></a><a href='#f339' class='c014'><sup>[339]</sup></a>
“Democracy,” wrote John Cotton to Lord Say and Sele, “I
do not conceive that ever God did ordeyne as a fit government
eyther for church or commonwealth. If the people be governers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>who shall be governed?”<a id='r340'></a><a href='#f340' class='c014'><sup>[340]</sup></a> We have already quoted
Gooch's statement that “democracy is the child of the Reformation,
not of the Reformers.” The democracy of Massachusetts,
slow in developing, was the child of the church-covenant
and of the frontier, not of the Puritan leaders.</p>

<p class='c001'>While the latter were thus attempting to found and maintain
an aristocracy or oligarchy to guard a church polity which
was unconsciously but implicitly democratic,<a id='r341'></a><a href='#f341' class='c014'><sup>[341]</sup></a> their position
was rendered precarious at the very outset, and increasingly
so as time went on, by the necessary presence in the colony of
that large unenfranchised class which was not in sympathy
with them. As we have seen, even under strong social and
political temptation, three quarters of the population, though
probably largely Puritan in sentiment and belief, persistently
refused to ally themselves with the New England type of
Puritan church. Their presence in the colony was undoubtedly
due to economic motives, more especially, perhaps, the desire
to own their lands in fee. It must also have been due to
economic considerations on the part of the Puritan rulers.
The planting of a Bible-Commonwealth might have been
possible without these non-church members, but the creation
of a prosperous and populous state was not, as was evidenced
by statistics throughout its life. Even of the first thousand
who came with Winthrop, it is probable that many were without
strong religious motives; that few realized the plans of the
leaders; and it is practically certain that the great bulk of
them had never seen the charter.</p>

<p class='c001'>Many of the more active soon wished to have some voice in
the management of their own affairs; and at the October
meeting of the General Court, one hundred and eight, including
Conant, Maverick, and Blackstone among the old planters,
requested that they be made freemen.<a id='r342'></a><a href='#f342' class='c014'><sup>[342]</sup></a> It became evident
to the dozen or so men who alone possessed the governing
power, that some extension of the franchise would be necessary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>if the leading spirits among their two thousand subjects were
not to emigrate again to other colonies, or to foment trouble
at home. On the other hand, the extension of the franchise
was, in their minds, fraught with the perils already indicated.
The decision to extend the franchise, but to limit its powers,
and to violate the terms of the charter by placing the election
of the governor and deputy in the hands of the Assistants
instead of the freemen, was probably the result of an effort
to solve this problem. Before the next meeting of the General
Court in the following May, at which the new freemen were
to be admitted, further thought had evidently been devoted to
the question, and another solution arrived at. Winthrop was
chosen Governor, not by the Assistants, as voted at the preceding
meeting, but by “the general consent of the Court,
according to the meaning of the patent”; and the momentous
resolution was adopted that “noe man shall be admitted to
the freedome of this body polliticke, but such as are members
of some of the churches within the lymitts of the same.”<a id='r343'></a><a href='#f343' class='c014'><sup>[343]</sup></a>
The first attempt on the part of its unenfranchised subjects
to secure a larger share of political liberty had resulted merely
in establishing, more firmly than before, the theocratical and
oligarchical nature of the government.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER VII<br> <br> AN ENGLISH OPPOSITION BECOMES A NEW <br> ENGLAND OLIGARCHY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In an earlier chapter, in discussing the problems which confronted
Elizabeth, we spoke of an established church as a
necessity in her day from all three standpoints—of religion,
morals, and politics. We also touched upon the simplicity of
problems as they appear to those in opposition, as contrasted
with their aspect to those who bear the responsibility of power.
In England, in the earlier part of the seventeenth century, in
spite of the example of Holland, the doctrine of the necessity
of a state church, to which all men must conform, in their
capacity of citizens as well as of Christians, was still held,
although the influence of the “dissidence of dissent,” as the
logical outcome of individual interpretation of the Bible, was
beginning to be felt. Voices were being raised in many quarters
denouncing the intolerance of the various sects, both
Anglican and Puritan; and, although the Protestants might
consider that the religious glacier which held all men in its
embrace was as rigidly frozen as ever, the ice was, in truth,
rapidly melting beneath the surface. To Englishmen in tolerant
Leyden, John Robinson was preaching that “magistrates
are kings and lords over men properly and directly, as
they are their subjects, and not as they are Christ's,” and that
by “compulsion many become atheists, hypocrites, and
Familists, and being at first constrained to practise against
conscience, lose all conscience afterwards.”<a id='r344'></a><a href='#f344' class='c014'><sup>[344]</sup></a> In England,
Chillingworth, through the doctrine of the innocence of error,
was elevating toleration into a principle of justice and a practicable
rule of government.<a id='r345'></a><a href='#f345' class='c014'><sup>[345]</sup></a> In the New World, Roger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>Williams was soon to begin his life-long struggle against what
he vehemently denounced as “that body-killing, soule-killing,
and State-killing doctrine” of religious persecution by the
arm of the civil power.<a id='r346'></a><a href='#f346' class='c014'><sup>[346]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>We cannot, perhaps, blame men for not being in advance
of their age, or even for being behind it. The founders of the
Bay Colony were but little qualified, by reason of the narrowness
of their views and the intensity with which they were
held, to lead men to any higher ground than that which they
had been accustomed to tread. Moreover, having changed
their place from members of an opposition to members of a government,
their new responsibilities would tend to foster even
more strongly that fear of innovation which is nearly always
characteristic of the middle-class man in power. The exercise
of authority is apt to prove an intoxicating draught, even to
the best-intentioned men who have been unaccustomed to it;
and, of the tiny group who now claimed absolute sway over
two thousand subjects, rapidly increasing to sixteen thousand,
none had held any position of administrative importance in
the old country. Some of them had, indeed, occupied offices,
but they were rather of a nature to encourage that intolerance
of contradiction, and tendency to arbitrary action upon a
small stage, which are apt, in time, to become characteristic
of the petty judge, the schoolmaster and the clergyman. Of
Endicott's whole career in England, for example, we know
only that his rector spoke of him as “a man well knowne to
divers persons of good note,”<a id='r347'></a><a href='#f347' class='c014'><sup>[347]</sup></a> which, in reference to a parishioner
in a small country town, more probably referred to
his moral character than to any administrative experience.
Winthrop had held an unimportant position in a law court.
Dudley had managed the estate of a nobleman. Cotton was
the rector of a large provincial parish. The work which they
and the other leaders did was done honestly; and although
the course they pursued, in regard both to the religious qualification
for the franchise, and to the later persecutions for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>religious beliefs, was, in the long run, to hamper the growth
of the colony and to be partly responsible for the eventual
loss of the charter, they should not be too severely condemned,
perhaps, for the illegal and unjust, as well as politically unwise,
course, upon which they now entered. It must be said,
however, that, when the great opportunity was offered them
of advancing the cause of religious liberty, they turned aside.
To the new voices being raised on behalf of justice and humanity,
the Massachusetts leaders were as deaf as Laud and
the Anglican hierarchy. Equally, and for the same reason,
each party solidly and consciously blocked the path to toleration
in so far as lay in its power.</p>

<p class='c001'>The problems of government in the new country soon came
thick upon the little group from the opposition in the old.
The notorious Morton, for example, was once more singing
and trading in “his old nest in the Massachusetts,” in the
autumn of the year in which Winthrop landed. There were
valid reasons, notably his selling fire-arms to the Indians,
which might have served adequately as warrant for his arrest
by the authorities; but when that action was decided upon,
the alleged grounds bore a curiously trumped-up appearance.
In the official order for his apprehension, no crime was mentioned;
and in his sentence the only matters cited were the
“many wrongs he hath done” the Indians, and the theft of
a canoe from them.<a id='r348'></a><a href='#f348' class='c014'><sup>[348]</sup></a> Whatever the moral nature of his intercourse
with the natives, it was not likely that, from their
standpoint, there had been any very serious crime committed
against them by a man living almost isolated in their midst,
and whose sole business was trading with them. The convenient,
but apparently unfounded, suspicions of a murder committed
by him in England, and a warrant procured from the
Chief Justice for his shipment thither, could not have served as
a basis for any sentence inflicted in Massachusetts.<a id='r349'></a><a href='#f349' class='c014'><sup>[349]</sup></a> The probable
truth is that the Puritans either wanted to teach the discontented
“old planters” a lesson, for which purpose Morton
offered himself as an easy victim, or they suspected, what was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>indeed the fact, that he was in communication with Gorges.<a id='r350'></a><a href='#f350' class='c014'><sup>[350]</sup></a>
Obviously, neither of these could be openly alleged as a cause
for the punishment they inflicted, which was extraordinarily
severe. He was put in the stocks and deported to England;
his entire property was confiscated, and his house burned
to the ground. Set at liberty in England with little delay,
he got into communication with Gorges, and was soon joined
by two other victims of colonial methods.</p>

<p class='c001'>Gorges, though a stanch supporter of the Church of England,
was in close relations with the Puritan peers. He and Warwick
were having constant dealings, as both were active in
the Council for New England, and his son John was a brother-in-law
of the Earl of Lincoln, in whose house, as we have seen,
the Massachusetts project took shape. There is nothing to
indicate any hostility upon his part to the Massachusetts
colony until 1632; and the several emissaries whom he secretly
sent there were probably dispatched for the sole purpose of
seeing whether or not the settlers were encroaching upon the
lands claimed by himself and his son Robert, whose rights,
it will be recalled, he specifically reserved when he consented
to the granting of the Massachusetts charter. The grantees
of that instrument, however, denied that the Gorges rights
had any legal validity, and claimed and occupied the disputed
land as their own. A quarrel was, therefore, inevitable, and
as the Puritans, it must be confessed, had little respect for
legality themselves, they could, when need required, be counted
upon to take such steps as they might see fit to oppose any
action of Gorges.</p>

<p class='c001'>Winthrop had been scarcely a month on the shores of the
Bay, when another newcomer arrived in the shape of one of
the most picturesque and mysterious characters who were
ever to stroll on Boston Common. Sir Christopher Gardiner,
Knight of the Sepulchre (somewhat whited), suddenly appeared,
with no ostensible business, but with that unexpected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>phenomenon in the Puritan colony, a pretty young mistress.
To be sure, he called her cousin, but it was soon suspected, as
Bradford somewhat quaintly wrote, that “she (after the
Italian manner) was his concubine.”<a id='r351'></a><a href='#f351' class='c014'><sup>[351]</sup></a> In spite of the fact that
a late defender has claimed that “he was unfitted for the quiet
pleasures of domestic life,”<a id='r352'></a><a href='#f352' class='c014'><sup>[352]</sup></a> he seems to have made some
efforts in that direction; for the authorities soon received
word from London to the effect that he had two wives there,
who were then in conference, and of whom one was calling
loudly for his conversion, and the other for his destruction.<a id='r353'></a><a href='#f353' class='c014'><sup>[353]</sup></a>
On the first of March, 1631, it was ordered by the Massachusetts
court that he and seven others should be sent prisoners
to England by the good ship Lyon;<a id='r354'></a><a href='#f354' class='c014'><sup>[354]</sup></a> but the knight, getting
word of what was proposed, fled to the Indians.<a id='r355'></a><a href='#f355' class='c014'><sup>[355]</sup></a> Some weeks
later he was taken into custody by the Plymouth people, who
asserted that they had found on his person evidence that he
was a Roman Catholic.<a id='r356'></a><a href='#f356' class='c014'><sup>[356]</sup></a> While he was lodged in jail in Boston,
letters addressed to him by Gorges, as well as one to the absent
Morton, came into the hands of Winthrop, who opened them,
and decided that they indicated a design on the part of Gorges
to regain possession of his land—an ambition not wholly
unnatural.<a id='r357'></a><a href='#f357' class='c014'><sup>[357]</sup></a> Whether or not the authorities decided that it
was wiser that Gardiner should not appear in England to add
his testimony to that of Morton, nothing further seems to
have been done to carry into effect the order for his deportation,
and he was soon set at liberty.</p>

<p class='c001'>Meanwhile a lonely settler from Maine had appeared in
Boston, and had looked with favor upon Gardiner's fair companion.
He decided to marry the lady and to take her back
to the Eveless Eden of the Androscoggin. Gardiner himself
accompanied them, and the curiously assorted trio spent the
winter together at Brunswick, from which season there was an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>odd echo in the Maine law courts nine years later, when
Gardiner's host, and not himself, was properly sued for a
warming-pan stolen by the knight during his chilly stay. In
the summer of 1632, Gardiner landed in England just in time
to add his witness to that of Morton and Ratcliffe in Gorges's
attack upon the Massachusetts charter.<a id='r358'></a><a href='#f358' class='c014'><sup>[358]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Ratcliffe, who was a mentally unbalanced servant of Cradock,
had apparently talked loosely about the government
and the Salem church. For these “mallitious and scandulous
speeches,” as the crime was designated in his sentence by the
court, he was whipped, had both his ears cut off, was fined the
impossible sum of £40, and banished from the colony.<a id='r359'></a><a href='#f359' class='c014'><sup>[359]</sup></a> He
was not long in joining Morton and Gardiner in England, and
becoming one more arrow in Gorges's quiver.</p>

<p class='c001'>These cases, moreover, though they proved more important
individually, in their reaction upon the colony, by no means
stood alone. A certain Thomas Gray, for an unspecified crime,
was banished, his house was pulled down, and all Englishmen
were enjoined from giving him shelter, “under such penalty as
the Court shall thinke meete to inflicte.” Thomas Dexter,
for saying, “This captious government will bring all to naught,”
adding that “the best of them was but an atturney, &#38;c.,” was
put in the stocks, fined £40, and disfranchised. Henry Lynn,
“for writeing into England falsely and mallitiously against the
government and execuccion of justice here,” was ordered
whipped and banished; while Thomas Knower was put in the
stocks for saying that, if punished, he would have the legality
of his sentence tried in England.<a id='r360'></a><a href='#f360' class='c014'><sup>[360]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The course of justice, if no worse than in contemporary England,
was evidently but little improved by its passage overseas,
or by being administered by those who had been so loud
in their denunciations of the summary methods of Laud and
the High Commission. It seemed to many, as to the “old
planter” Blackstone, that the tyranny of the “Lord-Bishops”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>had merely been exchanged for that of the “Lord-Brethren”;
and it was evident also that the fixed policy of the leaders was
to allow no appeals from their decisions to the home courts of
England. All the colonists, therefore, who would not, on the
one hand, wholly refrain from criticizing the policy and acts
of the leaders, and, on the other, prove themselves acceptable
to the clergy, and so secure the franchise by being elected freemen,
were wholly without representation, without voice in the
making of their laws, and without recourse to the courts and
king at home.</p>

<p class='c001'>As the charter was that of a trading corporation, the levying
of taxes was a mere development of the right to assess
shareholders, and, therefore, extended only to freemen. But
no such legal restriction was observed, and from the beginning,
the authorities taxed the non-freemen equally with themselves,
though denying them the political rights which they themselves
possessed.<a id='r361'></a><a href='#f361' class='c014'><sup>[361]</sup></a> Indeed, not only their property was thus
subject to enactments in which they had no voice, but their
time and the work of their hands as well; for the General Court
passed a law that all except members of the court, and officers
of the church and commonwealth, were liable to be impressed
for manual labor on all public works.<a id='r362'></a><a href='#f362' class='c014'><sup>[362]</sup></a> The town meeting,
indeed, seems to have been the only place in which the great
majority of the colonists could legally make their voice heard
at all, and there only upon questions concerning the most
trivial local matters.</p>

<p class='c001'>The New England town, already noted as one of the three
typical institutions in the development and influence of that
section, may be considered in its origin as “the politically
active congregation,” bound together, in addition to its church
ties, by a peculiar agrarian policy.<a id='r363'></a><a href='#f363' class='c014'><sup>[363]</sup></a> Originating at Plymouth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>it became universal throughout the Puritan colonies on the
mainland, and was reproduced with extraordinary fidelity of
detail wherever New Englanders migrated. The New England
colonies, for the most part, neither sold nor rented their
land, but granted it freely in fee to actual settlers, in rough
proportion to their present ability to use it.<a id='r364'></a><a href='#f364' class='c014'><sup>[364]</sup></a> In general most
of it was granted primarily to towns, which owned it in their
corporate capacity; and by them it was allotted to individuals
in the form of home-lots or arable land and meadow. The remainder
formed the “common,” for the use of all, under certain
restrictions. The whole land-system, as well as the methods
of cultivation, exhibited many striking resemblances to those
of our early Teutonic ancestors; and, some years ago, these
coincidences were largely insisted upon as cases of genuine survival.<a id='r365'></a><a href='#f365' class='c014'><sup>[365]</sup></a>
It is more probable that a return to favorable wilderness
conditions merely strengthened those primitive elements
still remaining in the manorial system, with which the settlers
were familiar in England. As we have already pointed out,
the geographical environment in New England, as contrasted
with that of the other colonies, tended strongly to develop the
type of compact settlement. This was further reinforced by
the form of emigration, which was distinctly of neighborhood
groups, and by the type of church government.</p>

<p class='c001'>The exigencies of the situation, when the settlers first landed,
had necessitated their dispersal in various communities, whose
members at once found it needful to manage their local affairs
to some extent by meeting together among themselves. The
charter made no provision for any but a general government;
nor, under it, did the company have any legal right to incorporate
other bodies. These more or less informal local governments
were, therefore, extra-legal both before and after the
passage of a township act by which it was attempted specifically
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>to give them certain rights of local administration. At
the town meetings, which at first were spontaneous, and afterward
regulated, all the inhabitants had the right to be present
and to take part in the discussion of public affairs, although
only the freemen were entitled to vote, except upon a few questions
of minor importance. The distinction was somewhat
similar to that in the churches, which all could attend, but in
the management of which only church members had a voice.
The town meeting, therefore, was a completely democratic institution
in only one of its aspects, although it came to have
great influence upon both political theory and practice.</p>

<p class='c001'>A further development brought these local communities into
working relations with the General Court. Owing to the distance
of the scattered settlements from Boston, and the danger
of all the freemen being absent at once from their homes, it
was enacted, in 1634, that every town should elect two or three
deputies, who should have the power of the whole, and who
should act as their representatives in the General Court.<a id='r366'></a><a href='#f366' class='c014'><sup>[366]</sup></a>
As the charter provided that seven of the eighteen Assistants
must be present in the Court in order to constitute a quorum,
that body was now composed of a small number of Assistants
and a steadily growing number of Deputies. As the Virginia
House of Burgesses had been established in 1619, and the
Bermuda Assembly in 1620, the representative government
provided for in Massachusetts was the third in the colonies.<a id='r367'></a><a href='#f367' class='c014'><sup>[367]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Owing to the close alliance maintained between the clergy
and the Magistrates, as the Assistants soon came to be called,
the body of deputies grew to be considered the more popular
element in the Court. It was clear that real grievances and
the democratic influences at work in the town meeting were
likely to develop into attacks upon the arbitrary power of the
very limited body of freemen. The form that the struggle
assumed was that of a contest, lasting twenty years, between
the deputies and the magistrates, with the influence of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>clergy constantly on the side of the latter. The freemen themselves
were, indeed, not all in favor of the arbitrary exercise of
power by the small oligarchical group which for so long remained
in control. As early as 1631, the people of Watertown,
when taxed for fortifying Newtown, declared that “it was not
safe to pay moneys after that sort, for fear of bringing themselves
and posterity into bondage.”<a id='r368'></a><a href='#f368' class='c014'><sup>[368]</sup></a> Although legally in the
right, they accepted Winthrop's interpretation of the charter,
which is interesting as showing how completely the unjustified
transformation from a company into a commonwealth
had already been effected in the minds of the leaders.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although the people, until well into the eighteenth century,
probably had little thought of becoming independent of England,
it seems clear from all the acts of the leaders, especially
the transfer of the charter itself, that it was their intention,
even before leaving England, to govern in as complete independence
of that country as future circumstances might permit.
They wished, it is true, to found a state for the glory of
God and the establishment of true religion, but in which, nevertheless,
they themselves should constitute the supreme power.
Every encroachment upon it, from any direction, was grudgingly
yielded to; and it is not unlikely that, even then, some of
them dreamed of an actual political independence. “We are
not a free state,” wrote Pyncheon to Winthrop, in 1646, evidently
with this in mind; “neither do I think it our wisdom
to be a free state; though we had our liberty, we cannot <em>as yet</em>
subsist without England.”<a id='r369'></a><a href='#f369' class='c014'><sup>[369]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The political history of Massachusetts under the charter
was thus made up of two separate elements. The first was
the resistance of the governing group to any effort of England,
legal or illegal, to assert her rights, even justly, over her colony;
and the second was the struggle of a part of the colonists
themselves, for toleration and liberty, against the governing
class. Even had the colony never separated from England,
we should, in all probability, have come to possess the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>measure of civil liberty and religious toleration that the English
have to-day; but that separation having taken place,
had the Puritan oligarchy retained and extended their power,
we should have but little of either. It is, therefore, the second
conflict which, although less dramatic, is the more vital in
the history of human freedom. We must now turn to consider
the earliest important attacks from both of the quarters
indicated.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of those from across the water, the first was launched, as
could well have been foreseen, by Sir Ferdinando Gorges, and
was brought upon the colony directly through the policy pursued
by its leaders. The untiring interest of Gorges in the
affairs of New England, and his hope of yet creating a profitable
settlement there for himself, were both well known to the
Puritans. The old knight had spent vastly greater sums in
the effort to plant the wilderness than had been contributed
by any individual among themselves. He had attempted the
colonization of Maine at a time when the men who were now
engaged in banishing his agents were hardly more than children.<a id='r370'></a><a href='#f370' class='c014'><sup>[370]</sup></a>
He had made no effort to disturb the Pilgrims during
their ten-years' stay at Plymouth, and would probably have
left the Massachusetts settlers also in peace, had it not been
for their denial of the rights he claimed in a part of the soil
they had preëmpted, and for their treatment of his emissaries.
The Massachusetts authorities, by throwing down the gauntlet,
had created a powerful enemy who was not slow in picking
it up.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1632, Gorges and Mason, with the assistance of Gardiner,
Morton, and Ratcliffe, prepared a petition, which was presented
to the Privy Council in December.<a id='r371'></a><a href='#f371' class='c014'><sup>[371]</sup></a> Winthrop stated
that among many false accusations and “some truths misrepeated,”
it accused the colony of separating from the Church
of England, and of threatening to cast off its political allegiance.<a id='r372'></a><a href='#f372' class='c014'><sup>[372]</sup></a>
Supporters of the company in England hastily put
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>into motion those unseen agencies that were most efficacious
in doing business at the court of Charles; and, in spite of what
seemed overwhelming odds against them, in courtly influence,
won an unexpected victory, even gaining a word of commendation
from the King.<a id='r373'></a><a href='#f373' class='c014'><sup>[373]</sup></a> Their success is involved in a mystery,
which, however, we suspect might be unlocked by that same
“golden key” which the Pilgrims were using contemporaneously
at another of the royal doors. Meanwhile, the Council
for New England had requested that the Company's charter
be presented for examination, and Humphrey had been
forced to confess that it was in New England, stating that,
though he had often written for it, he had been unable to
obtain it.<a id='r374'></a><a href='#f374' class='c014'><sup>[374]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The demand, however, was repeated from a more powerful
source two years later. In 1633, Laud had become Archbishop
of Canterbury, and had declared war upon the Puritans.
Colonial affairs, which had heretofore been considered,
when considered at all, by the Privy Council, were now put
into the hands of a body styled “the Lords Commissioners for
Plantations in General,” which was headed by the Archbishop,
and given almost royal powers in both civil and ecclesiastical
matters, including that of revoking all charters and patents
unduly obtained.<a id='r375'></a><a href='#f375' class='c014'><sup>[375]</sup></a> Gorges utilized this new opportunity, and
at once began to work upon the Archbishop's hatred of Puritanism,
in order to recover his own legal claims. On February
21, 1634, the Board, having taken into consideration the
great numbers of persons “known to be ill-affected and discontented,
as well with the Civil as Ecclesiastical government,”
who were daily resorting to New England, ordered that
Cradock produce the Massachusetts charter.<a id='r376'></a><a href='#f376' class='c014'><sup>[376]</sup></a> Upon receipt
of Cradock's first letter requesting its return, the authorities
at Boston decided to return an evasive answer, ignoring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>the Council's demand. After the first communication had
been followed by an official copy of the order itself, word was
returned by Winslow, who was acting as agent for both Plymouth
and Massachusetts, that the charter could not be sent
except by a vote of the General Court, which body would not
meet until September.<a id='r377'></a><a href='#f377' class='c014'><sup>[377]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Meanwhile, Gorges was plying the English authorities with
letters advising that a governor, “neither papistically nor
scizmatically affected,” be appointed for New England, modestly
suggesting that he himself was an eminently proper person
for the office, and urging that the Massachusetts charter
be repealed.<a id='r378'></a><a href='#f378' class='c014'><sup>[378]</sup></a> His wish was gratified as to the first two points,
and it looked as if he was at last to see the shores of that land
which had been the chief object of his thoughts for thirty
years. Winslow, whose suit, at first, had seemingly prospered,
was suddenly and dramatically confronted, in the presence of
Laud, with his old enemy Morton of Merry Mount, and, as
a result of the latter's accusations, was temporarily committed
to prison.<a id='r379'></a><a href='#f379' class='c014'><sup>[379]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The grandiose scheme that Gorges had conceived contemplated
the division of all New England among certain members
of the old Council, and the validating of the individual assignments
by legal sanctions. It was also arranged that the charter
should then be resigned by that body, which had only too
truly become, as the declaration read, “a Carcass in a manner
breathless.”<a id='r380'></a><a href='#f380' class='c014'><sup>[380]</sup></a> This was done in April, and in the following
month a writ of <span lang="la"><i>Quo Warranto</i></span> was entered, to deprive the
Massachusetts company of its own charter, as the final step
in the transformation of New England. Aside from the play
of conflicting influences involved, the leaders, by their handling
of affairs, had, without question, violated the terms of
that instrument, and so had given their adversaries a reputable
cause to plead. The verdict was adverse to the Company,
judgment was entered against such of the patentees as appeared,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>and the remainder were outlawed. The patentees,
however, refused to acknowledge the action of the courts, and
the charter was not returned, though again demanded two
years later.<a id='r381'></a><a href='#f381' class='c014'><sup>[381]</sup></a> Meanwhile, Gorges's new-risen hopes had been
wholly dashed. Though he had been appointed governor, the
King had provided him with no funds from the empty treasury,
and Gorges's own resources were always inadequate for
his undertakings. Mason, who was aiding him, suddenly died.
The ship which was to have carried the knight to his new
province broke as it was being launched, and delay followed
delay, while the aspect of public affairs was rapidly changing.</p>

<p class='c001'>This favorable turn, however, was not foreseen in the colony,
and immediately upon receipt of the news of the appointment
of the new Commission for Plantations, the Massachusetts
government prepared for armed resistance. A sentry
was posted on a hill near Boston, to give notice of the arrival
of any hostile ships; £600 was raised for the completion of
the fortifications on Castle Island; a military committee was
appointed; and, a few weeks later, the clergy were consulted
as to what should be done if a general governor were sent out
from England. Their unanimous answer was that “We ought
not to accept him, but defend our lawful possessions (if we are
able), otherwise to avoid or protract.”<a id='r382'></a><a href='#f382' class='c014'><sup>[382]</sup></a> It must be recalled
that the Massachusetts settlers were as yet Englishmen, and
not independent Americans; and the home government, whose
subjects they were, could hardly regard these acts and utterances
otherwise than as rank rebellion, however different an
aspect they might come to wear in the eyes of ourselves as
heirs of a subsequent and successful revolution. Political
events in England soon developed in such a way as to prevent
any very serious consideration of colonial affairs for another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>quarter of a century, and the policy of “avoid or protract,”
seemed temporarily to serve all purposes.</p>

<p class='c001'>The colonial government, which had thus assumed what was
practically a position of avowed independence of the king and
courts of England, next decided to take up a stronger line in
regard to its own subjects in the colony itself, for the spirit of
the Watertown freemen against taxation had evidently spread.
Just prior to the meeting of the General Court in the spring of
1634, every town deputed two men to consider such matters
as might come up; and after consultation, a demand was
made upon the governor to allow them to inspect the charter.
Having found upon examination that the General Court was
the only legal body entitled to legislate, they apparently inquired
why that power had been usurped by the magistrates.
Winthrop replied that it was because the General Court had
become unwieldy in size; and he made the suggestion that,
for the present, “they might, at the general court, make an
order, that, once in the year, a certain number should be
appointed, (upon summons from the governor) to revise all
laws, etc., and to reform what they found amiss therein; but
not to make any new laws, but prefer their grievances to the
court of assistants; and that no assessments should be laid
upon the country without the consent of such a committee,
nor any lands disposed of.”<a id='r383'></a><a href='#f383' class='c014'><sup>[383]</sup></a> It is difficult to conceive of a
more complete abrogation of the rights of even the very limited
body of freemen; and, though Winthrop does not tell us
how this astonishing offer was received, the records leave us
in no doubt. At the meeting of the General Court, it was
immediately voted that there should be no trial for life or
banishment except by a jury summoned by themselves; that
there should be four such courts a year, not to be dissolved
without their own consent; that none but the General Court
had power to make laws or to elect and remove officials; and
that none but the General Court had power to dispose of lands
or to raise money by taxation.<a id='r384'></a><a href='#f384' class='c014'><sup>[384]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>Another incident, of less importance, but interesting as
showing the feeling abroad and the means by which it might,
for a time, be suppressed, occurred at a meeting of the inhabitants
of Boston later in the year, to choose some men to divide
additional town-land. The voting was by secret ballot, for
the first time, and Winthrop, Coddington, and the other leaders
failed of election. The first stated in his account of the
affair, that the electors chose mostly men of “the inferior
sort,” fearing that the richer men would give the poor an
unfairly small proportion of land, the policy, he added, having
been to leave a large amount undivided for newcomers and
commons.<a id='r385'></a><a href='#f385' class='c014'><sup>[385]</sup></a> The argument, which was sound, might perhaps
have been considered sounder by the discontented, had the
governor himself, for example, not acquired by that time above
eighteen hundred acres, Saltonstall sixteen hundred, and Dudley
seventeen hundred.<a id='r386'></a><a href='#f386' class='c014'><sup>[386]</sup></a> After Winthrop had made a speech,
and the Reverend Mr. Cotton had “showed them that it was
the Lord's order among the Israelites to have all such businesses
committed to the elders,” a new vote was ordered and the
magistrates were elected.<a id='r387'></a><a href='#f387' class='c014'><sup>[387]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It was evident that, if the little group of leaders, lay and
ecclesiastic, were to retain power permanently, in view of the
spirit evinced by the people, and the extremely rapid growth
of the population, it could be only by securing a firmer hold
upon the body of magistrates and the election of freemen. A
few months previously, Cotton had preached a sermon arguing
that the magistrates, who were annually elected under the
charter, were entitled to be perpetually reëlected, except for
“just cause”; and he compared their rights to office with
those of a man in his freehold estate.<a id='r388'></a><a href='#f388' class='c014'><sup>[388]</sup></a> This suggestion seems
to have borne fruit something more than a year afterward,
when, it having been shown “from the word of God, etc., that
the principal magistrates ought to be for life,” it was voted
that a council should be created, to have such powers as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>General Court should grant them, and not to be subject to removal
except for crimes or “other weighty cause.” This, of
course, was again a violation of the charter, and, like so much
of the reactionary legislation, was due to the direct influence
of the clergy.<a id='r389'></a><a href='#f389' class='c014'><sup>[389]</sup></a> Though Winthrop, Dudley, and Endicott were
elected to the new offices, the council was never granted any
powers, and the plan failed.<a id='r390'></a><a href='#f390' class='c014'><sup>[390]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Of somewhat more practical service, in view of the fact that
church membership was an indispensable qualification for the
franchise, was the law, passed at the same court, that no new
churches could be organized without the approbation of the
magistrates and a majority of the elders of the preëxisting
churches, and that no man could become a freeman who was
not a member of a church so approved of. By this means a
degree of control, at least, could be maintained over the great
numbers of newcomers now arriving.</p>

<p class='c001'>We do not wish to convey the impression that the leaders
of the colony were animated by mere love of power or a vulgar
ambition, strong though the former was in most of them.
But the danger to the liberties of their subjects was no less
great because Winthrop and Cotton were wholly convinced
of the divine nature of their mission. It is too frequently
assumed that despotic acts are necessarily those of a self-conscious
despot; whereas, in most cases, they are merely the
readiest means employed for reaching ends which authority
may think itself rightly privileged, or morally bound, to attain.
Charles and Laud were no less certain than the rulers of Church
and State in Massachusetts, that their mandate was a heavenly
one. Liberty cannot mean one thing in old England and another
in New, nor can intolerance be condoned in the one and
condemned in the other. The King and the Archbishop were
no more closely allied, nor more bent upon forcing their own
will upon that of the people, than were the civil and ecclesiastical
powers of the little American commonwealth, however
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>worthy or unworthy the motives of each may have been.
Pride in the valiant work that the Massachusetts leaders did in
subduing the wilderness, and in the sacrifices that they made
for their religious beliefs, has tended to make their descendants,
in the words of the old English saw, “to their faults a
little blind, and to their virtues very kind”; but if the nations
of the world are to grow in mutual understanding and brotherly
feeling, their histories must be written from the standpoint
of justice to all, and not from that of a mistaken national
piety.</p>

<p class='c001'>We now come to the case of the first, and perhaps the most
conspicuous, individual who was to fall under the discipline of
both Church and State in New England. Roger Williams had
arrived in Boston as early as 1631. Added to a most winning
nature and a personality that ever exerted a charm over friends
and enemies alike, he brought with him a reputation for being
a godly minister, and within a few months after his arrival,
was invited by the church at Salem to become their teacher.
He had also, apparently, within only a few weeks of his landing,
been chosen to the same office by the Boston congregation,
but had refused to join with them because they would not
acknowledge themselves to be separated from the Church of
England.<a id='r391'></a><a href='#f391' class='c014'><sup>[391]</sup></a> He had also, thus early, declared his doctrine
that the power of the magistrates should be limited to civil
matters, and that they had no authority to punish the breach
of the Sabbath or other religious offenses.<a id='r392'></a><a href='#f392' class='c014'><sup>[392]</sup></a> For these reasons,
the General Court wrote a letter to Endicott, expostulating
with the Salem church for accepting Williams, which
that church apparently ignored.<a id='r393'></a><a href='#f393' class='c014'><sup>[393]</sup></a> He did not, however, remain
long, but removed to Plymouth, where he stayed preaching
until again called to Salem in 1634.<a id='r394'></a><a href='#f394' class='c014'><sup>[394]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Meanwhile, he had not only so extended his doctrine of the
separation of church and state as to deny that a magistrate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>had power to require an oath, but had added a new and, it
is needless to say, fundamentally dangerous doctrine for the
legal foundation of the colony, in his declaration that, the
Indians being the true owners of the soil, the King had had
no right to grant a charter, and the colony should repent
of having received it. The authorities might, perhaps, fear
the expression of such opinions, and his subsequent banishment,
the motives for which have always been the subject of
heated dispute from his own day to this, may have been caused
by his denial of the legal basis of the colony, as much as by
his theory of religious toleration. It was without doubt the
latter, however, which brought down upon him the special
hostility of the clergy. Winthrop, who like Bradford and
Winslow, had an affectionate regard for the young clergyman,
specifically stated that the ministers rendered their judgment
“that he who should obstinately maintain such opinions,
whereby a church might run into heresy, apostacy, or tyranny,
and yet the civil magistrate could not intermeddle,” should be
removed.<a id='r395'></a><a href='#f395' class='c014'><sup>[395]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The civil power was at once brought into play. Williams
was cited to appear, and the town of Salem was denied title
to certain lands which it claimed as its own, until it should
discard its teacher.<a id='r396'></a><a href='#f396' class='c014'><sup>[396]</sup></a> Williams then endeavored to have the
Salem church separate from all the others, and the congregation
addressed a sharp letter of reproof to the magistrates.
The final triumph was, of course, on the side of the established
authorities. Williams, after what seems to have been
a fair trial, was ordered to be banished,<a id='r397'></a><a href='#f397' class='c014'><sup>[397]</sup></a> the decree being subsequently
revised to take effect in the spring, provided Williams
would refrain from attempting to spread his opinions, which,
apparently, he was unable to do. The authorities, having
heard that he was planning to lead a colony to Narragansett,
and fearing that the “infection” would spread from there
throughout the churches, undertook to ship him back to
England; but he escaped in the middle of January, making
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>his way through the snow-filled forests to the safe confines and
hospitable savages of Rhode Island.<a id='r398'></a><a href='#f398' class='c014'><sup>[398]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>His subsequent prominence as the founder of that state,
and his written advocacy of the principle of toleration, have
tended to overemphasize the contemporary importance of
the proceedings just described.<a id='r399'></a><a href='#f399' class='c014'><sup>[399]</sup></a> The authorities had a fair
basis for their action, on civil grounds alone; and although
the religious aspect undoubtedly entered largely into the case,
it marked, in that respect, no new departure in policy.<a id='r400'></a><a href='#f400' class='c014'><sup>[400]</sup></a> It
merely showed somewhat more clearly, perhaps, that, in any
case which threatened to weaken the established relations of
church and state or to question the right of the latter to require
the most rigid conformity to the doctrines and practices of the
former, the magistrates and clergy could be counted upon to
act rigorously together. Although personally popular, Williams
had acquired few adherents who were willing to follow
him beyond a certain point in his struggle, and the victory of
the court created but a slight disturbance. The colony, however,
in order to avoid even the possibility of strife, had lost
what it could ill afford to spare—a mind of wider vision than
its own.</p>

<p class='c001'>If Williams's expulsion had caused no tumult, that was not
to be true of another case with which the authorities soon had
to deal. Ann Hutchinson, who had been a parishioner of
John Cotton in England, had come to Massachusetts with her
husband, later followed by her brother-in-law, John Wheelwright,
and had been in Boston about two years at the time
of Williams's banishment. She had acquired a considerable
influence among the women, due more, perhaps, to her kindly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>spirit and helpfulness in sickness, than to her brilliant mind,
which seems to have impressed itself upon many of the ablest
men in the colony. The New England of that day, as for
long after, offered almost no opportunity for the play of such
a restless intellect as hers except upon religious questions, and
Mrs. Hutchinson was, in addition, a sincerely religious woman.
After some time, during which we hear nothing of her, she
appeared as holding Thursday meetings in her house for those
women who had been unable to attend church on the preceding
Sunday, and to whom she rehearsed the sermons preached.
She soon passed on to comparing those of various clergymen,
and gradually evolved the doctrine that, while Mr. Cotton
and her brother-in-law preached a “Covenant of Grace,” all
of the others preached a “Covenant of Works”—a theological
distinction which has often been considered so baffling as to
elude understanding. Even at the time, Winthrop wrote that
“no man could tell (except some few, who knew the bottom
of the matter) where any difference was.”<a id='r401'></a><a href='#f401' class='c014'><sup>[401]</sup></a> It may be inferred,
however, that by a “Covenant of Grace” she meant a
religion based upon a direct revelation in the individual soul
of God's grace and love, while by a “Covenant of Works”
was intended a religion founded upon a covenant between
God as judge and man as fallen, which men had merely to
obey unquestioningly, as they obeyed the civil law, and of
which the minister was the official interpreter.<a id='r402'></a><a href='#f402' class='c014'><sup>[402]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It is needless to point out that the latter accorded with the
whole doctrine and polity of the Massachusetts church and
state, while the former would have undermined both as constituted.
To many, the preaching of a religion of love, as
contrasted with the harsh tenets of the established doctrine of
law and judgment, brought a joy and peace they had sought
in vain in the latter, and Mrs. Hutchinson's followers grew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>rapidly in number. Among them were included Mr. Cotton
himself,—who, however, drew back in the succeeding turmoil,—and
the new young Governor of the colony, Sir Harry Vane.</p>

<p class='c001'>Vane, as yet but twenty-three years old, high-born and
brilliant, but immature, had arrived in the autumn of 1635
in the ship that brought the Reverend Hugh Peter and John
Winthrop, Jr. He had come over, as had the younger Winthrop,
in connection with the plantation project of Lords
Say, Brook, and others; but he remained in Boston, and was
soon admitted a member of Cotton's church. During the
preceding years there had been from time to time various
disagreements between Winthrop and Dudley, both of whom
had occupied the office of governor, the troubles arising largely
from Dudley's touchy and overbearing nature. Reconciliations
had been effected by the kindly and patient Winthrop,
and the petty quarrels are of practically no historical importance,
save in that the people had taken sides to a certain
extent. Vane and Peter had been but a few months in
the colony, when, for reasons best known to themselves, they
undertook to arrange a meeting between Governor Haynes,
the two ex-governors, the three clergymen, Cotton, Hooker,
and Wilson, and themselves. The discussion finally centred
upon whether the mildness of Winthrop or the severity of the
fanatical Dudley was the wiser in governing the colony. The
question, as usual, was referred to the ministers for their opinion,
who gave it in favor of “strict discipline” for the honor
and safety of the gospel. Whereupon, Winthrop acknowledged
that he had been too lenient, and promised a stricter course
thereafter, and Massachusetts took one more step backward.<a id='r403'></a><a href='#f403' class='c014'><sup>[403]</sup></a>
The following spring Vane was elected governor.</p>

<p class='c001'>Meanwhile, Mrs. Hutchinson had won over practically all
the Boston church, except Wilson, Winthrop, and a few others,
who, however, were strong enough to defeat the proposal to
install Wheelwright as teacher.<a id='r404'></a><a href='#f404' class='c014'><sup>[404]</sup></a> The strife was gradually
spreading, and Vane, who had allied himself with the Hutchinson
party, made a flimsy excuse to resign the governorship.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>The Boston church and the Court both refused to consider
his reasons valid, and the resignation was withdrawn. A
conference of the ministers, called by the Court, was held in
December, to try to compose the differences, but accomplished
nothing except to increase the bitter feeling between the parties.
A day of fasting was proclaimed, and although Wheelwright
had removed to Mt. Wollaston, he attended the Boston
church on that occasion, and preached his famous “fast-day
sermon.”<a id='r405'></a><a href='#f405' class='c014'><sup>[405]</sup></a> For expressions contained in it, as falsely interpreted
by the authorities, he was declared by the Court to
have been guilty of contempt and sedition, the same body condemning
Stephen Greensmith to a fine of £40 for saying that
all the ministers, except Cotton, Wheelwright, and, possibly,
Hooker, taught a covenant of works.<a id='r406'></a><a href='#f406' class='c014'><sup>[406]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Wheelwright having next been summoned to appear before
the General Court, a petition was presented, signed by nearly
all the members of the Boston church, asking that the hearings
should be open to freemen, and that cases of conscience might
be first dealt with by the churches.<a id='r407'></a><a href='#f407' class='c014'><sup>[407]</sup></a> This was declared to be
“a groundless and presumptuous act.” Wheelwright's examination
was begun in private, and the authorities stated that
it would proceed <span lang="la"><i>ex officio</i></span>. This raised loud complaints among
the people, who avowed that it was but one of those High
Commission proceedings which they had left England to
escape. Wheelwright refused to answer the questions put,
and the hearings were finally allowed to be open. The clergy
were then asked by the Court whether they did teach a covenant
of works. All but Cotton replied in the affirmative, and the
verdict was thus foreshadowed. Nevertheless, it took two
days of further struggling, again behind closed doors, before
the sentence of sedition and contempt could be agreed to, and
the party of the priests and magistrates secure their victory.<a id='r408'></a><a href='#f408' class='c014'><sup>[408]</sup></a>
A petition, denying that any of Wheelwright's utterances had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>been seditious, was presented to the Court, signed by sixty
members of the Boston church, for which they were rebuked
by Winthrop.<a id='r409'></a><a href='#f409' class='c014'><sup>[409]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The majority of the Court, however, evidently feared the
next election, and secured the passage of a resolution requiring
that the elections should be held at Newtown, and not, as had
always been customary, at Boston.<a id='r410'></a><a href='#f410' class='c014'><sup>[410]</sup></a> At the election, in May,
Vane and Winthrop were the opposing leaders, and although
the former attempted some ill-judged political manœuvres,
the ecclesiastical party was wholly successful. Winthrop was
elected governor, Dudley deputy—governor, and Endicott,
apparently as a reward for his share in the proceedings, was
made a member of the unconstitutional life council, while
all the Boston Antinomians were defeated for the magistracy.
When, in answer to this, that town next day returned Vane,
Coddington, and Hoffe as deputies, the Court “found a means
to send them home again,” claiming that two of the Boston
freemen had not been notified of the election. The next morning,
Boston held a new election, and returned the same deputies,
and “the court not finding how they might reject them,
they were admitted.”<a id='r411'></a><a href='#f411' class='c014'><sup>[411]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The victory over Boston, however, was evidently not considered
sufficient, and the Court proceeded to pass an immigration
law, to the effect that no town could receive any
person for a longer time than three weeks without permission
of one of the council or two of the magistrates. In other
words, no Englishman could settle in Massachusetts without
personal permission from Winthrop, Dudley, or Endicott, or
two of their eight associates. The law had evidently been
framed to prevent any accession to the ranks of the Hutchinson
party, and was promptly put into execution on the arrival of
a considerable body of newcomers, including a brother of
Mrs. Hutchinson, who were forced to leave the colony after
having reached its shores.<a id='r412'></a><a href='#f412' class='c014'><sup>[412]</sup></a> Feeling naturally ran high, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>Winthrop defended, while Vane attacked, the validity and
justice of such an enactment.<a id='r413'></a><a href='#f413' class='c014'><sup>[413]</sup></a> With the law already alluded
to, placing the whole control of the franchise in the hands of
the magistrates and the clergy, and with this new law, which
gave the right of admission to the colony wholly to the former,
the control of the oligarchy would seem to have been fairly
complete.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Court, however, even as constituted as a result of the
May election, did not move rapidly enough in the prosecution
of Wheelwright, and was summarily dissolved in September.
Sixteen members were dropped, and the new Court, comprising
forty-two members, contained twenty-two new names.<a id='r414'></a><a href='#f414' class='c014'><sup>[414]</sup></a> Even
this purge was not enough, and two deputies were expelled,
one for declaring that the Boston petition was lawful, and the
other for declaring that he believed Wheelwright was innocent
and was being persecuted for the truth.</p>

<p class='c001'>Meanwhile, Vane had returned to England, and a synod of
all the clergy had met and declared that there were eighty-two
erroneous or blasphemous opinions involved in the controversy.<a id='r415'></a><a href='#f415' class='c014'><sup>[415]</sup></a>
Mr. Cotton, who had no taste for that banishment
which he claimed was no hardship, now went over to what was
evidently to be the winning side. With a broader mind and
wider vision than any of the other clergy of the colony, he
had not the courage to stand alone, beyond a certain point,
against their unanimity in intolerance. The higher promptings
of his nature were crushed by the united voice of the priesthood,
as Winthrop's had been so short a time before, and the
noblest of the colony's leaders, lay and clerical, from that time
tended to sink to the lower level of their fellows.</p>

<p class='c001'>Events now moved more swiftly. At the November Court,
Wheelwright was sentenced to be disfranchised and banished,
and was refused the privilege of an appeal to England.<a id='r416'></a><a href='#f416' class='c014'><sup>[416]</sup></a> He
was given fourteen days in which to settle his affairs, and at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>the beginning of winter was on his way to New Hampshire.
One of the expelled deputies was disfranchised and threatened
with banishment should he “speake anything to disturbe the
publike peace.” Another was also disfranchised and banished.
Two weeks later, seven of the signers of the petition were disfranchised,
and ten more, who acknowledged their “sin” in
having signed, were pardoned. The following week, seventy-five
men, in the towns of Boston, Salem, Newbury, Roxbury,
Ipswich, and Charlestown, were condemned to have all their
arms and ammunition taken from them unless they would
likewise acknowledge their “sin.” A law was passed that
any one who should “defame” any Magistrate or Court, or
any of their acts or proceedings, should be fined, imprisoned,
disfranchised, or banished.<a id='r417'></a><a href='#f417' class='c014'><sup>[417]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In the meantime, Mrs. Hutchinson had been brought to
trial. When, at its beginning, she asked what law had been
broken, the Court answered, “the fifth commandment,” which
enjoined her to honor father and mother, whereas she had
brought reproach upon the “fathers of the commonwealth.”<a id='r418'></a><a href='#f418' class='c014'><sup>[418]</sup></a>
When the trial was over, and the sentence given that she
should be “banished from out of our jurisdiction as being a
woman not fit for our society,” she said, “I desire to know
wherefore I am banished.” “Say no more,” answered the
Governor; “the Court knows wherefore and is satisfied.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It was evident now that no voice could be raised in criticism
of any acts of the civil or ecclesiastical authorities, and that
the minds and lives of the ten thousand or more inhabitants
of Massachusetts had come wholly under the control of their
rulers. One man, who with a group of people undertook to
organize a church without having secured the permission of the
magistrates and clergy, was fined £20 and imprisoned “during
the pleasure of Court.” Hugh Buet, being found guilty of
“heresy,” was condemned to leave the colony within three
weeks or be hanged. Two others were imprisoned for criticizing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>the government and clergy; and, for the same offense,
Katherine Finch was ordered to be whipped.<a id='r419'></a><a href='#f419' class='c014'><sup>[419]</sup></a> In 1635, a law
had been passed making church attendance compulsory for
all inhabitants, under pain of fine and imprisonment. Three
years later, it was enacted that every resident, whether a freeman
and church member or not, should be taxed for the support
of the ministers. In the Old World, the churches had been
satisfied with excommunication, but in Massachusetts, a law
was now passed that, if any person was excommunicated by
the church, he must endeavor to have himself restored within
six months, under penalty of “fine, imprisonment, banishment,
or further.”<a id='r420'></a><a href='#f420' class='c014'><sup>[420]</sup></a> That ominous “further” was evidently intended
to mean death, and it is difficult to conceive of a measure more
conducive to the rearing of a race of conforming hypocrites.</p>

<p class='c001'>The policy so ruthlessly followed by the leaders can hardly
be excused by attributing it to the spirit of the age or to the
necessity of maintaining civil order. They were all familiar
with the example of religious toleration in Holland; and in
neither Plymouth, Rhode Island, nor Connecticut was church
membership a legal requisite for the franchise. Moreover,
Massachusetts, only a few years later, in annexing the northern
settlements, permitted their inhabitants to vote without being
church members, although denying that privilege to her own
citizens.</p>

<p class='c001'>Criticism of the leaders' actions was severe and constant,
even from their best friends in England. The real father of the
colony, the Reverend John White, wrote to Winthrop in alarm,
saying that he desired him “to have an eye to one thinge, that
you fall not into that evill abroad, which you labored to
avoyd at home, to binde all men to the same tenets and practise.”
Stansby, in a letter to the Reverend Mr. Wilson, complained
that, on account of their strictness, over one half of
the people were not admitted to church membership, and that
this would do them much harm. Stephen Winthrop, temporarily
in London, sent home word to his brother John, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>“here is great complaint against us for our severity against
Anabaptists. It doth discourage any people from coming to
us for fear they should be banished if they dissent from us in
opinion.” Sir George Downing, a cousin of the younger
Winthrop, in a letter retailing English opinion of the colony,
speaks of that “law of banishing for conscience, which makes
us stinke everywhere.”<a id='r421'></a><a href='#f421' class='c014'><sup>[421]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Nor must the standpoint of the English citizen be neglected.
England's American possessions, in spite of monopolies and
charters, were coming more and more to be looked upon as
the heritage of the English people, as the land of opportunity
for those who fell by the wayside in life's race at home, as well
as for religious exiles. Yet here was one of the best parts of
the whole continent being monopolized by a band of people
who rejected, oppressed, and banished others, or at the least
deprived them of all political rights, not because they were
undesirable citizens, not because they were immoral, but
because they refused to conform to the peculiar church polity
and doctrine, neither Church of England nor English Puritan,
which the first settlers had evolved in the American wilderness.</p>

<p class='c001'>Winthrop, in his controversy with Vane over the immigration
law, and apologist historians since, have made much of
the possible technical rights under the charter possessed by
the company members, and their successors in perpetuity, to
choose their fellow citizens according to any standard, however
fanatical, however unjust, of which they might approve.
These rights were questionable, and the controversy has
usually ignored those of the potential English colonist at home.
But our interest does not lie in legal technicalities: it is concerned
with the influences that moulded New England; and
from that standpoint, we can only point to the results of
the policy of the first leaders and to its baneful effects. As
we noted above, Winthrop's finer impulses had been permanently
checked, while Cotton, who might have made a noble
leader, was now content to follow natures lower than his own.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>The voices that had pleaded for religious toleration, for civil
liberty, and for a religion of love, were silenced. The intellectual
life of the colony ceased to be troubled and entered
into peace, but it was the peace of death. The struggle for
civil freedom did, indeed, go on, and in that alone lay the sole
contribution of the colony to the cause of human progress;
for the almost complete suppression of free speech and free
inquiry surrendered the intellectual life of Massachusetts to
the more and more benumbing influence of a steadily narrowing
theology.<a id='r422'></a><a href='#f422' class='c014'><sup>[422]</sup></a> For two centuries, from the day that Winthrop
pronounced that verdict, “the Court knows wherefore
and is satisfied,” the social and religious life of New England
as a whole conformed to the rigid lines of Calvinism in its
harshest and least attractive aspects. In England, Puritanism
had been grafted upon a national stock of abundant
sturdiness and health. In the forests of America, uncultured
and ungrafted, the wild fruit grew steadily more gnarled and
bitter.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER VIII<br> <br> THE GROWTH OF A FRONTIER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In the first chapter we called attention to the importance of
the Appalachian barrier in long confining the process of colonizing
within bounds, and preventing that wide dispersion which
rendered so precarious the hold of France upon its far larger
American empire. The relation of area to barrier, in that
section chosen by the English, was, indeed, almost ideal for the
formation of colonies, and, subsequently, of a nation through
their union. While the mountains kept the original settlements
within bounds until their population and institutions
had both had opportunity to develop and take strong root,
the extent of the continental mass behind, simple in its physiographic
features, was sufficient for the growth of almost unlimited
numbers and a unified state, and, so, for the effective
influence upon the world of whatever form of culture might
there arise. The West Indian colonies, on the other hand, in
spite of their rapid growth, could not fail, eventually, to become
politically unimportant, merely from their limited area
and resulting limited population. Barbadoes, for example,
comprised only one hundred and sixty-six square miles, the
equivalent of one seventh of the land-surface of Rhode Island,
or one fiftieth of that of Massachusetts. Within a century
from its settlement, it contained no ungranted or uncultivated
land—a condition which must have been approximated long
before.<a id='r423'></a><a href='#f423' class='c014'><sup>[423]</sup></a> The possibility of growth, beyond a certain point,
was, therefore, lacking in the islands, and, from the same
cause, their development was to a great extent uninfluenced
by another factor, which was of marked importance in the continental
colonies and the nation for two centuries and a half.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>This factor was the constantly advancing frontier, with its
radical reactions upon the thought and institutions of the also
constantly expanding older settlements.</p>

<p class='c001'>American political thought has been moulded, to a very
great extent, by the two ideals, of unrestricted competition in
exploiting the resources of the continent, and of a democracy
fostered by the semi-isolated and self-reliant life of the frontier,
with its comparative equality of opportunity and of economic
status. Both these ideals, until a recent period, were developed
by the presence of free land, in which they had largely had
their origin.<a id='r424'></a><a href='#f424' class='c014'><sup>[424]</sup></a> As we have already pointed out, land in New
England, in the earliest period, was to be obtained without
either purchase price or rent, to which fact, perhaps, had been
due the large non-Puritan immigration that mingled with the
religious stream from 1630 to 1640.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is also to the influence of the frontier that the American
intellect owes some of its most marked characteristics: its
restlessness, its preoccupation with the practical, its lack of
interest in the æsthetic and philosophical, its desire for ends
and neglect of means, its preference of cleverness to training,
its self-confidence, its individualism, and its extreme provinciality.
The influence, moreover, has been a continuing one,
for almost every decade in American history, until 1890,
witnessed the creation of a new frontier, which lay just a little
beyond the settled regions, and reacted upon them.<a id='r425'></a><a href='#f425' class='c014'><sup>[425]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In describing the first expansion of the New England frontier,
therefore, we are concerned with the earliest manifestation
of one of the most potent forces in American history.
The fringe of little settlements along the coast had been, indeed,
the frontier of Europe; but with the planting of settlements
farther inland, an American frontier came into existence, to
react upon what, with the rapid movement of time characteristic
of a new country, soon became the conservative, older
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>East. That frontier has always been the refuge of the restless
and the discontented, of those who have desired a freer, if not
greater, economic opportunity, as well as of those who have
been unable to adjust themselves to the prosaic life of a settled
community, with its penalties of one sort or another for such
as will not yield at least lip-service to its social, religious, or
political beliefs. In Massachusetts there was no more room—if,
indeed, there were as much—for those who disagreed with
the authorities in any particular, than there had been at home;
and those who came to that colony in the hope of enjoying
any larger degree of religious toleration or civil liberty than
in England were promptly disillusioned. About the time of
the last events described in the preceding chapter, the prospects
for freedom of thought or action must have looked as dark to
the dwellers in Massachusetts not wholly in sympathy with
the rulers' policy, as it had looked to those same rulers in the
old country, when they met at the Earl of Lincoln's, and
decided to remove to the wilderness. The opposition having
become the government, it was now forcing a new opposition
to follow the same course, involuntarily by banishment or
voluntarily by free migration. Before continuing the story
of that movement, however, we must allude briefly to that
portion of the European frontier which lay northward of the
Puritan settlements, and which, like them, had been formed
by immigration from the Old World.</p>

<p class='c001'>During the period we are now discussing, the history of
Maine was the story of confused grants of territory and of
the planting of small isolated farming, fishing, and trading
communities. The existence led by the inhabitants, in their
solitary shacks or little villages, was that of a rough border
life in which the monotony of the hard, bitter winters, and the
routine of planting, fishing, or bargaining for furs, was punctuated
by an occasional murder among themselves, and by
quarrels, sometimes bloody, with the Indians and the French.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1629, the Province of Maine, as granted to Mason and
Gorges seven years previously, was divided between them,
Mason accepting as his share that portion lying between the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>Merrimac and the Piscataqua,—which received the name of
New Hampshire,—while Gorges retained the balance, extending
from the Piscataqua to the Kennebec.<a id='r426'></a><a href='#f426' class='c014'><sup>[426]</sup></a> Mention has previously
been made of the small beginnings at Pemaquid, Sheepscot,
and Monhegan to the eastward, and of Portsmouth and
Dover in what now became Mason's particular province. The
settlements next planted, at Richmond's Island, Pejebscot,
around Casco Bay, and elsewhere, were the work of servants for
English merchants or of individual emigrants, and were hampered
by the conflicting claims arising from the carelessly drawn
patents.<a id='r427'></a><a href='#f427' class='c014'><sup>[427]</sup></a> Gorges himself became interested in a new attempt
to colonize, and his nephew, William, was sent over as governor
of a little colony planted at York, which later was to
become the subject of one of those grandiose schemes of government
to which the old knight was so uncontrollably addicted.<a id='r428'></a><a href='#f428' class='c014'><sup>[428]</sup></a>
All of these early plantings, however, were of slight
historical importance.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although settlement was proceeding slowly and painfully,
the vast forests and many rivers of the province offered a rich
field for the exploitation of the fur trade, which was the main
object of the French in the north, and one of the principal
resources of the English settlements as well. The traffic, indeed,
had been the means by which the Plymouth Pilgrims
had bought their freedom from their merchant partners, and
we have already noted that colony's activities on the Kennebec.
A tragic incident that occurred at their little post on
that stream, located at what is now Augusta, is of interest
mainly as revealing the aggressive attitude which was later to
become the settled policy of the Massachusetts colony in relation
to its neighbors. Early in 1634, one Hocking, a fellow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>employed in an enterprise of Lords Say, Brook, and others,
on the Piscataqua, tried to poach upon the Pilgrims' patented
lands, and even to pass the trading station, in order to intercept
the Indians carrying their furs. The Pilgrims' agents
acted with restraint; but in the course of the dispute, Hocking
wantonly killed one of their men; whereupon a companion of
the slain man, “that loved him well,” as Bradford records,
shot Hocking dead.<a id='r429'></a><a href='#f429' class='c014'><sup>[429]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Although the Plymouth men had been entirely in the right,
a garbled version of the affair was sent to England and also
to Massachusetts. Needless to point out, that colony had
absolutely no jurisdiction whatever in the quarrel, which had
occurred far outside its bounds, and not even in the unclaimed
wilderness, but within the legal limits of its older neighbor.
Nevertheless, the authorities at Boston arrested John Alden,
one of the Plymouth magistrates, who happened to be there
at the moment, and who had been at the Kennebec when the
affray occurred.<a id='r430'></a><a href='#f430' class='c014'><sup>[430]</sup></a> This was naturally resented, even by the
peace-loving Pilgrims, and letters requesting Alden's release
were dispatched by the Plymouth government to Dudley.
One of these, at least, that governor tried to suppress, but
“Captaine Standish requiring an answer thereof publickly in
the courte,” he was forced to produce it.<a id='r431'></a><a href='#f431' class='c014'><sup>[431]</sup></a> Alden was released,
but Standish, who had been the bearer of the letter, was bound
over to appear at the next Massachusetts court, to testify to
the Pilgrims' patent. Finally, after Winslow and Bradford
themselves had gone to Boston and conferred with Winthrop,
the matter was adjusted, and Dudley and Winthrop wrote to
the Lords in England the true version of the murder; but it
was not likely that the other settlements would soon forget the
high-handed proceedings of the Bay Colony in an affair so obviously
beyond its jurisdiction.<a id='r432'></a><a href='#f432' class='c014'><sup>[432]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But the trading post on the Kennebec was not the sole concern
of the Pilgrims in Maine, nor was that province the scene
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>merely of contentions arising from conflicting English land-grants,
or from rival colonial jurisdictions. It had been the
stage on which the curtain had first risen in the struggle for
empire between England and France, and was now to witness
new episodes in that long drama. Still farther north the
contest had recently become acute. Sir William Alexander,
by virtue of an English grant, had claimed a large portion of
French America, and Sir William Kirk had seized Port Royal
and Quebec. By the treaty of St. Germain, however, in 1632,
England agreed to restore “all places occupied in New France,
Acadia, and Canada by the subjects of the King of Great
Britain,” although the boundaries of those vaguely localized
regions were not specified, and remained matters for contention,
which meant raiding and Indian warfare, for over a century
to come.<a id='r433'></a><a href='#f433' class='c014'><sup>[433]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Meanwhile, several more places had been occupied by the
Pilgrims and those associated with the Plymouth colony. In
1630, a “very profane young man,” Edward Ashley by name,
had started a trading post on the Penobscot, which the Pilgrims
feared might injure their fur business on the Kennebec.<a id='r434'></a><a href='#f434' class='c014'><sup>[434]</sup></a>
In spite of scruples, therefore, they joined with Ashley, and
that person having been drowned at sea, after being released
from the Fleet prison in London, they came into sole possession.<a id='r435'></a><a href='#f435' class='c014'><sup>[435]</sup></a>
They did not long enjoy it in peace, however, for the
following year the French descended upon them and carried
away all their goods, valued at nearly £500, leaving word with
the agents that “some of the Isle of Rey gentlemen had been
there.” Allerton, who had broken with the Pilgrims, had
also begun to trade, at Machias; and, a couple of years later,
suffered in like manner from the French, who killed two of his
men, and carried off all the others, as well as the whole stock of
goods, which, as Bradford says “was the end of that projecte.”<a id='r436'></a><a href='#f436' class='c014'><sup>[436]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In spite of their own heavy loss, the Pilgrims had clung
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>to the Penobscot until, in 1635, d'Aulnay, acting under orders
from the French King to clear the coast of the English as far
as Pemaquid, seized the post, and shipped the local agents back
to Plymouth. The Pilgrims hired a vessel, and dispatched an
armed force to try to regain possession; but, owing to the
conduct of the man whom they had engaged to effect the enterprise,
it failed miserably, and they merely entailed upon
themselves a heavy additional loss. Massachusetts, when
called upon for help, though she realized the danger to herself
from the increasing aggressiveness of the French, refused aid
unless the infinitely poorer Plymouth colony would bear the
entire expense. That colony was, therefore, obliged to desist,
and Bradford bitterly complained that not only did the Bay
people thus do nothing to defend the common frontier, but that,
owing to their cupidity, they even sold food and ammunition to
the French, and so increased the menace both from them and
their Indian allies.<a id='r437'></a><a href='#f437' class='c014'><sup>[437]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In Mason's province of New Hampshire, settlement, though
more peaceful, was also proceeding but slowly beyond the
Dover and Portsmouth plantations already noted. As the
settlers of those two places were Episcopalians, and as an
opportunity was offered to buy out the Hilton interest in the
former, the Massachusetts leaders urged some of their friends
in England to acquire it, with the result that Lords Say and
Brook, Sir Richard Saltonstall, and others came into possession,
and sent out additional colonists.<a id='r438'></a><a href='#f438' class='c014'><sup>[438]</sup></a> This pouring of new
wine into the old Dover bottle produced a series of explosions,
which subsequently prepared the way for annexation
by Massachusetts. Mason died in 1635, and bequeathed his
province to his family.<a id='r439'></a><a href='#f439' class='c014'><sup>[439]</sup></a> Two years later occurred the Antinomian
controversy in Massachusetts, and the expulsion of
Wheelwright, whom, when discussing that episode, we left on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>his way to New Hampshire. He succeeded in making the
winter trip to the settlements on the Piscataqua, and the
following spring, with a few associates and the help of his new
hosts, he founded the town of Exeter, the inhabitants entering
into a written compact for their self-government.<a id='r440'></a><a href='#f440' class='c014'><sup>[440]</sup></a> That
the Massachusetts authorities would have preferred that he
should die alone in the winter's snow is hardly a charitable
supposition; but just what they did wish for is uncertain; for
they wrote a letter of remonstrance to the New Hampshire
people, saying that they “looked at it as an unneighborly
part” that they should help any one expelled by themselves.<a id='r441'></a><a href='#f441' class='c014'><sup>[441]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>One of these northern towns, from its first settlement, had
been considered by Massachusetts as under its own jurisdiction.
In March, 1637, the General Court had ordered that a
plantation should be started at Wenicunnett,—the name
being later changed to Hampton,—a little more than three
miles north of the Merrimac.<a id='r442'></a><a href='#f442' class='c014'><sup>[442]</sup></a> It was thus slightly outside
of the bounds of the patent, if that were construed, as it had
been construed to that time, to include only such land north
of the river as lay within three miles of it.<a id='r443'></a><a href='#f443' class='c014'><sup>[443]</sup></a> The project may
mark, however, the first tentative step toward the colony's
later, and wholly unwarranted, interpretation of that instrument,
so as to include all the territory lying south of a line
drawn due east from a point three miles north of the most
northerly part of that stream, to the ocean, thus including
practically all of New Hampshire and a large part of Maine.
About a year and a half after the “bound house” was built,
a group of colonists went to take possession of the new site.
The Exeter men at once objected to this encroachment of
Massachusetts on their neighborhood; but the General Court
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>replied that the new settlement was within their patent, and
that they looked upon the protest as “against good neighborhood,
religion and common honesty.” They did, however, quietly
send out a surveying party, and having found that the part
above Pennacook was north of the line of 43½ degrees, they
phrased a new answer to Exeter's renewed protest, saying that,
while they relinquished none of their rights, nevertheless, as
the Exeter men did not profess to claim anything which might
fall within the Massachusetts patent, the matter would be
allowed to rest. The way was thus left open for future aggression,
and the Court immediately proceeded to erect the new
settlement into a legal town.<a id='r444'></a><a href='#f444' class='c014'><sup>[444]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The frontier north of Massachusetts had thus, for the most
part, come into being without any action on her part, except
in the two settlements last noted. Owing to the location between
the French and English, and the uncompromising geographic
factors of soil and climate, the vast forested area, comprising
over two thirds of all New England, increased but little
in population throughout the century; and by 1700 New
Hampshire had but six thousand souls, or less than that of
the Bay Colony at the time that Wheelwright left it. The
northern provinces, unhappily for themselves, were destined
to play the part of buffer states between the French, with their
savage allies, and the more safely located colonies in the south.</p>

<p class='c001'>In tracing the foundations of the latter, we find the influence
of Massachusetts far more potent, for they were being
laid mainly by men who found scant room in that increasingly
reactionary commonwealth. The founders of Rhode Island
and Connecticut alike condemned the religious and political
policy that the Bay Colony had now definitely made its own;
and the more democratic and tolerant forms of government,
which developed in the two former, “represented more nearly
the principles which underlie the government of the United
States to-day than any other of the British colonies.”<a id='r445'></a><a href='#f445' class='c014'><sup>[445]</sup></a> The
seeds of both political and religious liberty had been brought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>to America by the Massachusetts colonists; but the leaders,
partly from a dread of losing their own influence, and partly
from a genuine fear of noxious weeds, had done their best to
interfere with their growth. The founders of Rhode Island
and Connecticut, with less desire for personal power, and
greater courage as to tares in the wheat, watered and nursed
the seeds of liberty, which bore an abundant harvest. In
Rhode Island, indeed, the weeds flourished riotously; but the
faith of the founders was justified in both colonies, and their
commonwealths marched with Holland at the head of those
struggling for human freedom, while England and Massachusetts
yet lagged and nagged.</p>

<p class='c001'>The lands around <a id='corr184.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Narrangansett'>Narragansett</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_184.13'><ins class='correction' title='Narrangansett'>Narragansett</ins></a></span> Bay had been known for
some time to be attractive as sites for colonizing, when Williams
made his way thither after his banishment, in the winter
of 1636. In spite of frequent trading with the Indians, however,
only one settler had as yet located there permanently.
William Blackstone, who had left England because he disliked
the tyranny of the Lord-bishops, and who had, as we
have seen, an equal aversion for that of the Lord-brethren,
had quietly left his plantation in Massachusetts, and betaken
himself to the wilderness north of Providence.<a id='r446'></a><a href='#f446' class='c014'><sup>[446]</sup></a> A lover at
once of peace, of books, and of freedom, there is something
singularly attractive in his little known personality. He called
his new home “Study Hill”; and there in his orchard grew
the first “yellow sweetings” ever known, which, later, when
he occasionally preached to the newcomers, he handed around,
“to encourage his younger hearers.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus, while, owing to the great services Williams was to
render the colony, he is entitled to the name of its founder, he
was not its first settler, nor was the little band that planted
Providence with him in 1636 the only one to lay the foundations
of the future commonwealth. Nor had he himself, apparently,
any intention of doing so. “It pleased the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>high,” he wrote, many years afterward, “to direct my steps
into this Bay, by the loving private advice of that very honored
soul Mr. John Winthrop the Grandfather, who, though
he was carried with the stream for my banishment, yet he personally
and tenderly loved me to his last breath. It is not
true, that I was imployed by any, made covenant with any,
was supplied by any, or desired any to come with me into
these parts.”<a id='r447'></a><a href='#f447' class='c014'><sup>[447]</sup></a> The others came, however, and the leading
idea of the settlement was reiterated four years later in the
proposals for a form of government, when the “arbitrators”
noted that they agreed “as formerly hath bin the liberties of
the town, so still, to hould forth liberty of conscience.”<a id='r448'></a><a href='#f448' class='c014'><sup>[448]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In 1638, another group, of eighteen persons, including William
Coddington, settled the town of Portsmouth; and in the
following year, that little hamlet planted an offshoot at Newport,
while a few individuals from both Providence and Portsmouth
organized Warwick.<a id='r449'></a><a href='#f449' class='c014'><sup>[449]</sup></a> These four towns were absolutely
independent of each other, and of any superior government of
any sort, except England. Although Newport and Portsmouth
partially combined in 1640, it was not until seven years
later, when the charter of 1644 finally went into effect, that
there was any colony of Rhode Island, or a united government
over the several settlements.<a id='r450'></a><a href='#f450' class='c014'><sup>[450]</sup></a> It thus offered a great contrast
to the Massachusetts colony, in which the towns were
the creatures of the General Court; and it was this extreme
looseness of organization, combined with religious toleration,
which formed the leading characteristic of the Rhode Island
political experiment. Although the settlers at Providence
had signed an agreement to unite for purposes of government,
there were no town officers, and practically no organization,
until four years later. The agreement was merely to yield
obedience to such orders “as shall be made for public good of
the body in an orderly way, by the major consent of the present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>inhabitants, masters of families, incorporated together in
a Towne fellowship, and others whom they shall admit unto
them only in civil things.” These masters of families met
once a fortnight, discussed their common affairs, and decided
them by majority vote.<a id='r451'></a><a href='#f451' class='c014'><sup>[451]</sup></a> The government was thus almost a
pure democracy, only women, minors, and bachelors being
excluded. Even when the towns were united, and a more
elaborate governmental machinery was set up, the extremely
democratic trend of thought was evidenced in the remarkable
provision that the General Assembly could not initiate legislation,
but that laws were first to be considered in each town,
and that only after all four had considered them, were they to
be sent to be acted upon by the Assembly, all legislative initiative
thus being retained in the hands of the people.<a id='r452'></a><a href='#f452' class='c014'><sup>[452]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>With such looseness of organization, and extreme individuality
of thought and action, another characteristic was bound
to be lack of harmony, with frequent bickerings and disputes.
These were soon in evidence, and it was found also that a pure
democracy and absence of restraint were not compatible with
orderly living. As the commonwealth grew, the difficulties
were met in the spirit of men who, believing in liberty and toleration,
were yet forced to make concessions to human nature;
while, on the other hand, the Massachusetts authorities met
their difficulties in the spirit of men who honestly disbelieved
in democracy and toleration, and whose concessions were
forced by a growing demand for things in which they had no
faith. In Connecticut, also, the leaders were, happily, on the
side of that part of the people, important in all the colonies,
who were struggling upward toward a larger liberty, and who,
even in Massachusetts, were slowly bringing it into being.</p>

<p class='c001'>Knowledge of the existence of the Connecticut River, and
of the advantages of its rich bottoms as sites both for trading
and for planting, seems to have been first acquired by the
English through information given to the Pilgrims by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>Dutch. Friendly intercourse between Plymouth and New
Amsterdam had been opened by the latter as early as 1626;
and the Dutch not only taught the Pilgrims the value of wampum
in the Indian trade, but, seeing how barren a site they
had chosen for their settlement, told them of the Connecticut,
and “wished them to make use of it.” However, “their
hands being full otherwise, they let it pass” until, having been
solicited by Indians who had been driven from their homes
there by invading Pequots from the West, they dispatched
several exploring and trading expeditions in 1633.<a id='r453'></a><a href='#f453' class='c014'><sup>[453]</sup></a> The same
Indians had also earlier requested the Massachusetts people
to make a settlement, but they had declined.<a id='r454'></a><a href='#f454' class='c014'><sup>[454]</sup></a> The Pilgrims,
having made up their minds to erect a permanent trading post
on the river, also asked the Bay people to join them; and when
the latter refused, alleging their poverty, they even offered to
provide the capital for both if Massachusetts would assume
half the responsibility. This, likewise, being refused, the Pilgrims
went on with the project alone, after telling the Bay authorities
that they could have no cause to complain, as they had
now had ample opportunity to join; to which they assented.<a id='r455'></a><a href='#f455' class='c014'><sup>[455]</sup></a>
This was in the middle of July, and although the Massachusetts
leaders had done their best to discourage the Pilgrims, by telling
them the place was “not fit for plantation,” and by picking
other flaws in the project, nevertheless, four weeks later, they
had themselves dispatched a bark to Connecticut to trade, and
John Oldham, going overland, had also spied out the resources
of the place, and trafficked with the Indians there.<a id='r456'></a><a href='#f456' class='c014'><sup>[456]</sup></a> In view of
all their actions, then and subsequently, it would seem difficult
to avoid the conclusion that the Massachusetts authorities,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>having been offered by their neighbors a chance to share in a
profitable opportunity, deliberately tried, by fraud and force,
not only to obtain all the profits for themselves, but to prevent
the very people whose enterprise it was from retaining any
share in it. Not possessing the interpretative advantages of a
New England ancestry, one is, perhaps, limited to remarking
that the business dealings of ultra-religious people are often
peculiar.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Dutch, meanwhile, seem to have repented of their
former hospitality, probably because of the warnings that the
English had early sent them of their encroachment upon
English territory, and of the rapid growth of the eastern
colonies, which might threaten even their occupation of the
Hudson.<a id='r457'></a><a href='#f457' class='c014'><sup>[457]</sup></a> Hearing of the projected settlement by Plymouth,
a party was sent from New Amsterdam in January to buy
land from the Indians,<a id='r458'></a><a href='#f458' class='c014'><sup>[458]</sup></a> and some of the Dutch were already
ensconced in a little fort, on the present site of Hartford,
when the English arrived in the late summer. In spite of
Dutch protests, however, the Pilgrims, in their “great new
barke,” sailed past the fort, and, passing north of the bounds of
the Hollanders' Indian purchase, settled at what is now Windsor,
buying the soil from its savage occupants. A later attempt
by the Dutch to dislodge them by threatened violence proved
unavailing.<a id='r459'></a><a href='#f459' class='c014'><sup>[459]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>Meanwhile, on the same day on which Winthrop recorded
in his Journal the results of the Massachusetts expedition to
Connecticut, he also entered the arrival of the ship Griffin,
eight weeks from England, with John Cotton, Thomas Hooker,
Samuel Stone, and John Haynes among her passengers. Cotton,
as we have seen, remained in Boston, but the others immediately
went on to Newtown, where a body of Hooker's
English congregation had preceded him by a year.<a id='r460'></a><a href='#f460' class='c014'><sup>[460]</sup></a> Of this
transplanted body, Hooker and Stone now became pastor and
teacher. It is not likely that Hooker, with the political views
he possessed, could have found the Massachusetts atmosphere
congenial; and a year later, he and his congregation applied
to the General Court for permission to remove to Connecticut.
The reasons they gave were the lack of land for expansion at
Newtown, the fear that otherwise Connecticut might fall into
the hands of other English or the Dutch, and, lastly, “the
strong bent of their spirits to remove thither.” The Court,
however, refused the petition, alleging many reasons, which, in
the main, came to the fear that such a defection would weaken
the colony, and tend to draw away future emigrants from it.<a id='r461'></a><a href='#f461' class='c014'><sup>[461]</sup></a>
In the debates on the subject, a majority of the deputies were
in favor of allowing Hooker and his party to leave if they
wished, while a majority of the magistrates opposed it. This
raised the question whether the magistrates could veto a vote
of the more numerous body of deputies, which was the more
popular and democratic of the two. As the result of a sermon
preached by Cotton the contest, which had promised to become
bitter, was postponed, and the Newtown settlers were
granted additional land in their present neighborhood.<a id='r462'></a><a href='#f462' class='c014'><sup>[462]</sup></a> The
incident is interesting, not only as marking the beginning of
the political struggle between the two elements in the legislature,
which we shall have occasion to follow later, but also as
an early example of that fear which the East has always had
of the growth of its western frontier and its desire to check it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Owing to continued pressure, however, the legislature withdrew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>its opposition the following year, and in 1635 permission
was granted the towns of Watertown, Roxbury, and Dorchester
to move anywhere, provided that they would continue
subordinate to the Massachusetts government—a condition
which that government had no legal right to impose. A few
months later it went further, indeed, and passed a law that
no one could leave the colony without permission of a majority
of the magistrates.<a id='r463'></a><a href='#f463' class='c014'><sup>[463]</sup></a> As, under a previous law, no one could
settle in Massachusetts without the consent of the half-dozen
or more men mainly in control, so now no one, however uncongenial
his surroundings or urgent his need, could leave
without permission from the same little group.</p>

<p class='c001'>Parties from Dorchester at once availed themselves of the
Court's consent to leave, and by July were arriving daily on
the Connecticut. On that river no spot would suit them except
that already bought and occupied by the Pilgrims, from
which the Massachusetts people now tried to oust them. In
reply to a protest from Governor Bradford, the Dorchester
men had the effrontery to answer that, as to the land settled
by the Pilgrims, God “in a faire way of providence tendered
it to us.” Upon this bit of fraud and hypocritical cant, Bradford
caustically commented that they should “abuse not Gods
providence in such allegations.” Massachusetts, however,
was strong, and the Plymouth people were weak; and although
the latter did finally wring a reluctant acknowledgment that
the right was on their side, nevertheless they were forced to
yield fifteen sixteenths of their land, and were allowed only
one sixteenth and a little money, in an enterprise which was
wholly theirs, in which they had courteously tendered Massachusetts
a half interest, and which was located entirely outside
any territory to which that colony had any legal title. There
was good reason for Bradford's note in his diary, that the controversy
was ended, “but the unkindness not so soone forgotten.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The winter was very severe, and many of the new settlers
were obliged to return to Boston; but in the spring, Hooker,
with most of his congregation, emigrated to the river, traveling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>overland, with their herds of cattle, the precursors of an
endless western stream. These newcomers, Bradford carefully
notes, as we also are glad to do, treated the Pilgrims more
fairly. By the end of 1636, there may have been eight hundred
people in Connecticut, settled mainly at Hartford, Windsor, and
Wethersfield, while the little settlement of Springfield, within
the legal limits of Massachusetts, had also been planted.<a id='r464'></a><a href='#f464' class='c014'><sup>[464]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>These settlements, at first, were merely plantations and not
organized towns. They apparently had no officers, except
constables,—who, Massachusetts tried to require, should be
sworn by one of her own magistrates,—and the body politic
consisted of the inhabitants, who met together, as we have
found them doing in Rhode Island, to decide upon their common
interests. The territory, however, in which they were
located, was also claimed at the time by a group of patentees,
including Lords Say, Brook, and others, who had been granted
the lands by the Earl of Warwick in 1632, but who had made
no attempt to enter upon them until three years later, when
they sent John Winthrop, Jr., to act as governor, and took
other action looking toward settlement. Winthrop, who had
come to Boston in the ship with young Vane, was there at the
time that the emigration from Massachusetts took place,
and Hooker and the other emigrants consulted him concerning
such rights as his principals might claim. As a result, an
agreement, to last one year, was entered into between Winthrop,
acting for Say, Brook, and their associates, and Hooker
and his, which provided that a court of eight magistrates
should be created, with power to summon a General Court,
until further advices could be received from England. This
agreement, for purposes of record, was ratified in the Massachusetts
General Court, but was not a “commission” from
that colony, as often stated.<a id='r465'></a><a href='#f465' class='c014'><sup>[465]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>On May 31, 1638, when a new form of government was
under consideration, Hooker preached his famous sermon,
in which he laid down the doctrines that “the choice of public
magistrates belongs unto the people by Gods own allowance,”
and that “they who have the power to appoint officers and
magistrates, it is in their power, also, to set bounds and limitations
of the power and place unto which they call them,”
because “the foundation of authority is laid, firstly, in the free
consent of the people.”<a id='r466'></a><a href='#f466' class='c014'><sup>[466]</sup></a> Neither to Hooker, nor to his fellow
colonists of Connecticut, was this last principle new, either in
theory or in practice. He was arguing, not for a democratic
government, which they already possessed, but for a fixed
code of laws to rule the magistrates in their actions. The
following year, the constitution of the new government was
adopted by the residents of the plantations of Hartford,
Wethersfield, and Windsor.<a id='r467'></a><a href='#f467' class='c014'><sup>[467]</sup></a> That constitution provided for
a General Court, in which each of the three original plantations
should be represented by four deputies, and which should
have the authority to incorporate towns. It was only subsequent
to the creation of this general government by the
inhabitants of the commonwealth, that the towns, as political
entities, came into being. Freemen were merely required to
be passed upon by the General Court, no religious qualification
being attached to the franchise. It is noteworthy that the
governor was not allowed to serve for two successive terms,
and that no reference was made to any external authority,
not even to that of the king.</p>

<p class='c001'>While the descent of the “Fundamental Orders” of Connecticut
can be traced in every step from the earliest charters
of the trading companies, the transition was now complete.
From such as we saw Tudor monarchs granting to merchants in
the fifteenth century, past all those which we have noted as
milestones by the way, the progress had been as steady as it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>was unperceived, from the privileges possessed by a few expatriated
English traders and their clerks, dwelling among
foreigners, to the self-governed commonwealth of a people in
a land which they had made their own. While the charters,
however, served as the framework of their government, the
foundation of their political philosophy was found in the church
covenant, which the Separatists had used in Europe for forty
years before the Mayflower sailed; and the constitution of
Connecticut was thus equally descended from religious theory
and from the practice of trade.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although there was little in the Fundamental Orders, as
settled in 1639, which cannot be found in previous custom or
legislation in Massachusetts or Plymouth, nevertheless, only
those elements which were of a democratic tendency were
put into the new constitution, and there was distinctly a more
democratic attitude on the part of the leaders and people
than in the Bay Colony. Such provisions as that making the
governor ineligible for immediate reëlection, and the franchise
independent of religious qualification, probably show a reaction
from the rule of Massachusetts.</p>

<p class='c001'>The contrasted influences which the new colony and its
parent were bringing to bear upon the development of American
thought at this time may best be illustrated by the theories
of their several leaders. Perhaps the two most influential
men in New England in 1640, and the two who most deserved
the positions assigned them, were John Winthrop, the leader in
Massachusetts, and Thomas Hooker, the leader in Connecticut.
Winthrop's opinion of democracy as “the worst of all
forms of government,” we have already noted, and may contrast
with Hooker's belief that the complete control of their
rulers “belongs unto the people by Gods own allowance.”
In the important question whether judges should render arbitrary
decisions wholly according to their personal views, or
be limited by a fundamental body of laws, the two leaders
were equally far apart. “Whatsoever sentence the magistrate
gives,” wrote Winthrop, who opposed any such limitation,
“the judgment is the Lord's, though he do it not by any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>rule prescribed by civil authority.”<a id='r468'></a><a href='#f468' class='c014'><sup>[468]</sup></a> “That in the matter
which is referred to the judge,” asserted Hooker, on the other
hand, “the sentence should lie in his breast, or be left to his
discretion, according to which he should go, I am afraid it is
a course which wants both safety and warrant. I must confess,
I ever looked at it as a way which leads directly to tyranny,
and so to confusion, and must plainly profess, if it was in my
liberty, I should choose neither to live nor leave my posterity
under such a government.”<a id='r469'></a><a href='#f469' class='c014'><sup>[469]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The aristocratic and oligarchical tendencies at work in Massachusetts
there received enormous additional strength from
the fact that the clergy were almost a unit in their support of
reactionary ideas. This was a defect which was, to a certain
extent, inherent in the Calvinistic ministry; and the failure of
the contemporary Puritan colony in the Caribbean was, in
considerable measure, due to the outrageous claims of the
Puritan ministers there upon the civil power.<a id='r470'></a><a href='#f470' class='c014'><sup>[470]</sup></a> The influence
of the Puritan clergyman upon his more devout followers
could be equaled only by that of the Catholics, and it is difficult
for the modern layman to realize its full extent. It came
about in part from the Puritan doctrine already noted, that
nothing in life was untinged with a religious aspect. If no
one dreams now of any necessity of consulting the clergy, as
such, with reference to the fashion in clothes or the economic
and social policy of the nation, it is partly because those matters
are no longer considered as religious, but purely temporal.
The opinion of a clergyman, therefore, is of no more value
than that of the well-informed layman, with his broader practical
experience of life, if, indeed, of as much. One does, however,
have recourse to a specialist, and a banker's opinion is
sought on finance, and a doctor's on health. As, according to
Puritan theory, there was no act which was not of a religious
or moral character, the clergyman was, so say, a specialist on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>one aspect of everything, and from that standpoint his advice
must be sought in every detail of life, and his influence was
correspondingly great.</p>

<p class='c001'>The individuals who emigrated to Rhode Island and Connecticut
were mainly those who were dissatisfied with the
restrictions imposed by Massachusetts. That process of secondary
selection had now begun which was to continue to winnow
out from every new community the most adventurous and
independent, and to plant them again to the westward in still
newer settlements, where, in turn, the process would again be
repeated. In the colonies now forming, therefore, there was a
freer opportunity for the seeds of liberty to grow than in the
old Bay. The new commonwealths had, in addition, the great
advantage that in them, at least at their beginning, the influence
of the clergy was wholly upon the side of freedom; and
in estimating the results of priestly power in New England, it
is only just to recall that Roger Williams and Thomas Hooker
were clergymen, as well as the narrower divines of Boston and
her sister towns.</p>

<p class='c001'>The westward movement of New England was to continue
until her sons and her institutions were to be found in a continuous
chain of communities from Portland on the Atlantic
to Portland on the Pacific, and the influence of New England
thought upon the life of the nation cannot be overestimated.
In so far as the origins of that thought can be traced back to
any definite leaders, or individual colonies, it was evidently the
ideas of Williams and Hooker, rather than those of Winthrop,
with all his high qualities, which were to dominate the American
people, and to be absorbed into their very being.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the same time that these new communities and influences
were coming into existence, there was the possibility of
another experiment being tried, in colonial matters, of a radically
different sort.</p>

<p class='c001'>The group of Puritan leaders, Warwick, Say, Brook, and
others, whom we noted earlier as being interested in promoting
Puritan colonization both in New England and in the <a id='corr195.36'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Carribean'>Caribbean</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_195.36'><ins class='correction' title='Carribean'>Caribbean</ins></a></span>,
had continued to be actively engaged in colonizing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>latter; while by their acquisition of the Hilton patent in New
Hampshire, and the grant in Connecticut, they were still in
possession of large tracts in the former. Since the emigration
of Winthrop in 1630, affairs in England had not improved
politically, though they had distinctly done so economically.
About 1634 or 1635, nearly all of the group of leaders with
whom we are particularly concerned suffered in one way and
another from the influence of the Court party. Warwick, who
had been forced out of the Council for New England three years
earlier, was attacked under the forest laws, and also made to
divide his lord-lieutenancy of Essex. Pym was sued by the
Attorney-General, and Barrington, Say, and Brook suffered
in their estates.<a id='r471'></a><a href='#f471' class='c014'><sup>[471]</sup></a> In July, Humphrey, the Earl of Lincoln's
brother-in-law, arrived in Massachusetts with “propositions
from some persons of great quality and estate,” who were
thinking of emigrating if satisfactory arrangements could be
made.<a id='r472'></a><a href='#f472' class='c014'><sup>[472]</sup></a> In October, the younger Winthrop went to England,
returning a year later with his commission as governor of a
projected colony at the mouth of the Connecticut.<a id='r473'></a><a href='#f473' class='c014'><sup>[473]</sup></a> At the
end of November, 1635, twenty men arrived there, and under
the direction of Lyon Gardiner, a fort was erected at Saybrook.
Saltonstall, one of the patentees, had also, a few
months earlier, attempted to plant some men higher up the
river; but they had been driven out by the same lawless Dorchester
party that had fallen on the Pilgrims, causing Saltonstall
a loss of £1000.<a id='r474'></a><a href='#f474' class='c014'><sup>[474]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Among the proposals made by Say, Brook, and the others
to Massachusetts, as conditions of their emigrating to New
England, it was stipulated that there should be two ranks in
the commonwealth—gentlemen and freeholders; that the
power of making and repealing laws should belong to both
ranks, but that the governor should always be chosen from the
higher. To these and the other proposals the authorities in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>the colony wholly agreed, but with the proviso that the church-membership
qualification for the franchise must be retained.<a id='r475'></a><a href='#f475' class='c014'><sup>[475]</sup></a>
The theocracy of Massachusetts, under the guidance of its
ministers, had drifted far from the current of English life.
Englishmen have always had a thoroughly healthy hatred of
ecclesiastical rule in civil affairs, and, whatever country squires,
noblemen's factors, or tradesmen and mechanics, might be willing
to do, it could not be possible that such men as Warwick,
Say, Brook, and Pym could place their political rights and
careers wholly in the hands of the narrow-minded ministers
and congregations of the little Massachusetts town churches.
On that account, and because of the turn of affairs in England,
the project was given up, and when, three years later, Warwick,
Brook, Say, and Darley announced definitely that they
were going to emigrate, it was not to New England but to their
island in the Caribbean. Although they were not permitted
to do so, the fact marks the distinct breach which had now
taken place between the rulers of Massachusetts and the leaders
of the Puritan party in England. The mistaken policy of the
colony, which earlier had brought alarmed protests from her
less powerful friends at home, had now definitely alienated her
most influential ones. The selfish attitude toward her neighbors,
already shown upon the Penobscot, the Piscataqua, and
the Connecticut, and which, unfortunately, was to become
more aggressive and unscrupulous, also lost her the friendship
of her sister colonies. The result was that, when the real
struggle came with the English government, a generation later,
Massachusetts, although, thanks to her geographical position
and aggressive acquisitiveness, she had become the most powerful
of the New England group, found herself with hardly a
friend in the old country or the new.</p>

<p class='c001'>The work of extending the frontier was not a mere matter
of discussions or of peaceful penetration into an untenanted
wilderness. Owing to the great plague, which had so nearly
annihilated the natives in the regions where the settlers had
first planted, the Indian danger had never been a serious one,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>and no such massacre as almost wiped out the Virginia colony
need have been apprehended. The savage, however, had been
an important element in the life of the settlements. As friend
or spying enemy, he was as constantly in and out of the little
villages as he is of the pages of the early records. Although
there was, unluckily, little that the white man could teach him
that was of any service, he, on the contrary, taught the colonists
many a useful lesson. He showed them how and where
to plant, trapped their game and gathered in their stock of
furs, guided them through the almost trackless forests, and, in
a multitude of ways, gave them knowledge of the land which
they had entered and of the products it might yield. In the
background, nevertheless, always lurked the danger that the
natives might grow tired of being slowly dispossessed, that
they might decide to make an end of a situation which the more
far-sighted among them could not fail to see would inevitably
more and more narrow the free range for their savage life. In
the fifteen years since Bradford and his little band had landed
in an almost deserted spot, the white population had grown
alarmingly. Moreover, their increasing numbers and desire
for expansion would naturally lead the settlers to adopt a
more aggressive attitude toward the natives in any dispute
occurring between them. There was more and more probability
of trouble, arising from individual outrage on the part
of an unscrupulous or ruffianly white, or of some aggrieved or
drunken Indian, of which the organized power of the former
would but too likely take full advantage. The Old Testament
texts on dealing with those outside the pale of God's chosen
people offered little comfort to the Indian, should the Puritan
divines ever start on the war-path.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the beginning of 1633 word was received in Boston that
a certain Captain Stone had been murdered by the Pequots,
or Indians allied to them, after having landed at the mouth
of the Connecticut. The exact truth of what occurred is not
known. Stone, who was a trader from Virginia, was a drunken,
dissolute, and thoroughly worthless character, and very
likely provoked the natives by some act. On the other hand,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>their stories of what happened did not agree, and were not
above suspicion.<a id='r476'></a><a href='#f476' class='c014'><sup>[476]</sup></a> The Massachusetts authorities reported the
matter to Virginia, and no further action was taken until the
following year, when an embassy from the Pequots arrived at
Boston. That tribe had become embroiled in a quarrel with
the Narragansetts on the east, and the Dutch on the west,
and were, therefore, anxious to smooth their relations with
the English. They agreed to deliver up the two men who
had killed Stone, to surrender their rights to Connecticut, and
to pay damages in furs and wampum. A few days later a
number of Narragansetts appeared, who had come to waylay
the Pequots on their way home; but the Massachusetts authorities
purchased the safety of the savages and promise of peace
between the two tribes, by offering the Narragansetts some
of the Pequot wampum. Although the Bay Colony had thus
bought the Pequot title to Connecticut with the blood of the
slain Virginian, the natives had no idea, apparently, of observing
the terms of the bargain, nor did the English take further
steps in the matter until two years later, when the younger
Winthrop, then at Saybrook, was commissioned to treat with
the savages regarding rumors of recent outrages, and to
declare war if he could not obtain satisfaction.<a id='r477'></a><a href='#f477' class='c014'><sup>[477]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>A fortnight later news came of the murder of John Oldham,
and the capture of two boys, in his small boat, while off Block
Island on a trading voyage. The natives of that island, who
were subordinate to the Narragansetts, were the guilty parties,
but the crime seems to have been committed with the connivance
of the Narraganset sachems, except Canonicus and
Miantanomo. Through the intercession of Roger Williams,
the latter sachem secured the release of the two youngsters,
while emissaries of Massachusetts, who went to treat with
Canonicus, returned home fully satisfied. So far, matters
had been conducted reasonably and patiently. Suddenly,
however, on the advice of the Massachusetts magistrates and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>ministers, the policy was completely changed, and a course
of blundering stupidity and criminal folly was entered upon.
John Endicott, with about a hundred volunteers, was ordered
to proceed to Block Island, where he was instructed to put all
the men to death, without making any effort to distinguish
between guilty and innocent. The women and children were
to be carried off, and possession taken of the island. Thence
he was to go on to the Pequots, demand the murderers of Stone
and Oldham, and a thousand fathoms of wampum, and to
secure, by consent or force, some of the children as hostages.<a id='r478'></a><a href='#f478' class='c014'><sup>[478]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Endicott possessed none of the qualities of a military leader,
and although his lack of knowledge prevented this bloody
decree from being carried out, he managed to do just enough
to enrage the savages without intimidating them. The party,
after two days' searching, failed to find the island Indians,
who were in hiding in the underbrush, but burned their wigwams,
mats, and provisions, staved their canoes, and valiantly
slew their dogs. They next proceeded to Saybrook, where
Lyon Gardiner, who, in his little outpost, was responsible
for the lives of twenty-four men, women, and children, did his
best to warn Endicott of his folly. The corn-fields of the Saybrook
people were two miles from the fort, and if the Indians,
who had shown themselves suspiciously unfriendly of late,
should be stung to revenge by Endicott, starvation and massacre
would confront the settlement. “You come hither to
raise these wasps about my ears,” said Gardiner, “and then
you will take wings and flee away.” In spite of the dictates
of common sense and humanity, Endicott proceeded to do
just that. At Pequot Harbor he killed two Indians, burned
many wigwams, staved the canoes, and then sailed away to
the safety of Boston, leaving Saybrook and the towns on the
Connecticut at the mercy of the savages, whom Massachusetts
had now roused to fury.<a id='r479'></a><a href='#f479' class='c014'><sup>[479]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Pequots immediately made peace with the Narragansetts,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>urging them to a common war against the English.
Such a combination, under the circumstances, would have
meant a disaster of the first magnitude, and Massachusetts
was now forced to ask the help of the only man who could
avert it, but whom she had already driven from her company—Roger
Williams. In response to most urgent appeals sent
from the Governor and Council, he at once started, “all alone
in a poore canow, and to cut through a stormie wind with great
seas, every minute in hazard of life, to the Sachem's house.”
There he remained three days, and by means of his friendship
with Miantanomo, he won the Narragansetts back to the side
of the English, and broke up the proposed alliance between
the savages. In consequence of this inestimable service, Winthrop
and some of the Massachusetts council, Williams wrote,
“debated whether or no I had not merited, not only to be recalled
from banishment, but also to be honored with some
mark of favor”; but neither the authorities nor the contemporary
historians, except Winthrop, had the generosity to say
a word of the man who had saved New England.<a id='r480'></a><a href='#f480' class='c014'><sup>[480]</sup></a> In the
fall, Miantanomo and other Narragansett sachems went to
Boston, and signed a treaty with the English, which included
an offensive alliance against the Pequots.</p>

<p class='c001'>Meanwhile, the results of the folly that Massachusetts had
perpetrated, and against which Plymouth as well as Saybrook
had formally protested, now made themselves felt.<a id='r481'></a><a href='#f481' class='c014'><sup>[481]</sup></a> Three
men were killed at Saybrook, another was roasted alive, a
trader was murdered at Six-mile Island, then two more at Saybrook,
and another on his way up the river. At Wethersfield,
nine men were slaughtered, and two young girls carried into
captivity.<a id='r482'></a><a href='#f482' class='c014'><sup>[482]</sup></a> The horrors of Indian warfare became the hourly
dread of every inhabitant along the frontier, thanks to the
Massachusetts magistrates and ministers. Having, as Gardiner
predicted, raised the wasps about his ears and those of all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>the English along the river, Massachusetts now asked help of
Plymouth, as she had before turned to Williams. That colony
agreed to lend aid, but in doing so, recalled to her stronger
neighbor how she had refused help against the French when
the Pilgrims were the petitioners; how she had interfered with
their trade on the Kennebec; and how she had deprived their
Connecticut pioneers of their lands.<a id='r483'></a><a href='#f483' class='c014'><sup>[483]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But the settlers on the latter river could not await the slow
movements of the Bay Colony, if the lives of their wives and
children were to be saved. At the Connecticut General Court
of May 1, 1637, war was declared against the Pequots, and
ninety men, from the three plantations, were levied for immediate
service.<a id='r484'></a><a href='#f484' class='c014'><sup>[484]</sup></a> The expedition, under command of Captain
John Mason, with some Indian auxiliaries under Uncas, immediately
proceeded to Saybrook, where they were joined
by Underhill, who happened to be there, and a few additional
men.<a id='r485'></a><a href='#f485' class='c014'><sup>[485]</sup></a> A skirmish, in which the Indians, whose fidelity had
been doubted, acquitted themselves loyally, encouraged them
not a little. The original plan had been to sail down the coast
to the Pequot River and to attack the enemy directly, but
this was wisely changed at the suggestion of Mason. According
to the new plans, the party set sail for Narragansett Bay,
with the design of then returning overland, and making a
surprise attack on the Pequots, who were expecting it from
the water. After landing on the shore of the Bay, and being
reinforced by several hundred Narragansetts, Mason marched
his band from eight in the morning until an hour after dark,
when they camped about two miles from the Pequot fort.
It had been decided to attack only the larger of the two villages,
a palisadoed enclosure of an acre or two.<a id='r486'></a><a href='#f486' class='c014'><sup>[486]</sup></a> About one o'clock,
the English were on the march again, but were deserted by all
the Indians, Narragansetts and Mohegans alike, before reaching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>the fort. The palisade having two entrances, opposite
one another, it was agreed that two parties, led respectively,
by Mason and Underhill, should make simultaneous attacks
upon them. In spite of the fact that the Indians had been
warned, by the barking of their dogs, of the approach of the
enemy, Mason boldly jumped over the brush piled at the entrance,
and was followed by his men. The other party also
entered at the opposite side, and the slaughter of the dazed
and half-awakened savages began. Seeing, however, that the
resistance might prove too much for his men, Mason snatched
a torch from a wigwam and set fire to the village, which,
owing to the strong wind blowing, was soon ablaze. The
English now had only to withdraw, and to shoot any wretched
savage who attempted to climb over the palisade. In the
early dawn of that May morning, as the New England men
stood guard over the flames, five hundred men, women, and
children were slowly burned alive.<a id='r487'></a><a href='#f487' class='c014'><sup>[487]</sup></a> Not over eight escaped,
and there were but seven captives. The English lost two
killed and twenty wounded. It is difficult to imagine what
thoughts must have been in the minds of the Puritans as they
slowly roasted the Indian women and children. Mason merely
notes that, by the providence of God, there were one hundred
and fifty more savages than usual in the village that night.</p>

<p class='c001'>The English, carrying their wounded, retreated to the ships,—which
fortunately had come into Pequot Harbor,—as the
savages from the smaller village were hampering their movements.
With the vessels had also arrived Captain Patrick
and forty men from Massachusetts, that colony having voted
one hundred and sixty, and Plymouth sixty, although too late
to take part in the expedition. The bulk of the Pequot nation
was now destroyed, and it remained only to make an end of
the few hundred who had thus far escaped. Sassacus, the
sachem, being repudiated by his own followers, fled with seventy
warriors to the Mohawks, and the English indefatigably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>ran down detached parties. In a swamp twenty miles from
the Dutch line, eighty of the Pequots' “stoutest men,” with
two hundred old people, women, and children, made a last
stand. After being subjected to the fire of the English for
some hours, the two hundred non-combatants surrendered,
while the warriors fought to the last man, twenty finally
escaping through the surrounding lines. The other savages
turned against the all but annihilated Pequots, and “happy
were they,” wrote Mason, “that could bring in their heads to
the English: Of which there came almost daily to Windsor or
Hartford.” In all, during the campaign, over seven hundred
were killed or made captive.<a id='r488'></a><a href='#f488' class='c014'><sup>[488]</sup></a></p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Of the prisoners some were divided between Uncas and
the Narragansetts, while the rest were kept by the English,
or sold into bondage in the West Indies.<a id='r489'></a><a href='#f489' class='c014'><sup>[489]</sup></a> In the division of
this human spoil, the clergy took its part. “Sir,” wrote the
Reverend Mr. Peter to Governor Winthrop, “Mr. Endecot and
myself salute you in the Lord Jesus. Wee have heard of a
dividence of women and children in the bay and would bee
glad of a share viz: a young woman or girle and a boy if you
thinke good. I wrote to you for some boyes for Bermudas,
which I thinke is considerable.”<a id='r490'></a><a href='#f490' class='c014'><sup>[490]</sup></a> Fifteen boys and two women
were sent thither as slaves, but whether for the profit of the
Reverend Peter, Winthrop does not say. Roger Williams
pleaded over and over again, but in vain, with the Massachusetts
authorities for a more lenient course. “Since the
Most High delights in mercy, and great revenge hath bene
allready taken,” he advised incorporating the survivors among
the friendly Indians; but though, only a short time before, the
Massachusetts authorities had been pleading with Williams
to save themselves, they now turned a deaf ear to his intercession
for the natives.<a id='r491'></a><a href='#f491' class='c014'><sup>[491]</sup></a> The Narragansetts and Mohegans
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>were both anxious to adopt the few survivors of their powerful
enemies, according to Indian custom, so that Williams's suggestions
were as practicable as they were merciful. Two
hundred were finally so allotted by Connecticut, when the last
remnants of the Pequots submitted and the River plantations
entered into a treaty with Uncas and Miantanomo.<a id='r492'></a><a href='#f492' class='c014'><sup>[492]</sup></a> From
the end of the Pequot war, all the New England colonies
adopted not only Indian but negro slavery, and it was wholly
due to economic, and not ethical, causes that the institution
did not take root. In the one small locality in all New England
where it proved profitable, it did so root itself, and the
importing of slaves for use in the other colonies long constituted
an important part of Puritan trade.<a id='r493'></a><a href='#f493' class='c014'><sup>[493]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The contest between the English and the Indians had been
inevitable from the start. The murders of the two traders
were but the sparks that touched off the explosive material
which had long been accumulating. The struggle, with varying
details and proximate causes, but based upon the unchanging
fundamental conflict of the natures and economic
interests of the two races, was to be repeated over and over
again as the American frontier advanced. Endicott's stupid
campaign, and, perhaps the too thorough absorption of Old
Testament examples, had made the struggle almost inhumanly
bloody in the first advance of that frontier in New England.
The effect, however, was complete. It was to be nearly forty
years before the savages regained sufficient strength, and
found a leader to attempt again to dispute the relentless advance
of the Puritan <a id='corr205.28'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='planters'>planters.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_205.28'><ins class='correction' title='planters'>planters.</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>CHAPTER IX | | ATTEMPTS TO UNIFY NEW ENGLAND</p>

<p class='c008'>As a result of the complete crushing of the power of the
Pequots their whole country was opened to peaceful settlement,
and the extension of the frontier in that direction became
rapid. Within about two years from the signing of the
treaty with the savages, the foundations were laid of Guilford,
New Haven, Milford, Stratford, Fairfield, Norwalk, and
Stamford along the Sound, and of Southampton and Southold
on the eastern end of Long Island, thus making a continuous
line of English settlement up to the Dutch boundary, if not,
indeed, within it.<a id='r494'></a><a href='#f494' class='c014'><sup>[494]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>For its size, New Haven was undoubtedly the wealthiest
colony in New England, its assessed valuation, the year after
it was planted, having been £33,000, or the present equivalent
of, perhaps, $700,000.<a id='r495'></a><a href='#f495' class='c014'><sup>[495]</sup></a> Its founders, under the leadership
of the Reverend John Davenport, a Nonconformist London
clergyman, and Theophilus Eaton, a schoolmate of his, had
arrived in the early summer of 1637, just in time to take part
in the Antinomian controversy and the taxes for the Pequot
war. Mr. Davenport was requested to contribute to the
former, and Mr. Eaton to the latter.<a id='r496'></a><a href='#f496' class='c014'><sup>[496]</sup></a> Their company was
a distinguished one, including several other wealthy London
merchants besides Eaton; five ministers; four school-teachers,
among whom was the first president of Harvard; the father
of Elihu Yale, the founder of Yale University; and Michael
Wigglesworth, the “lurid morning star” of New England
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>verse.<a id='r497'></a><a href='#f497' class='c014'><sup>[497]</sup></a> Both Davenport and Eaton had been, for some years,
members of the Massachusetts Bay Company, and that company's
colony made great efforts to retain the new body of
settlers within its own bounds. While the leaders took under
consideration the various offers made to them, they either
found them unsatisfactory, or had already determined to
establish an independent colony of their own.<a id='r498'></a><a href='#f498' class='c014'><sup>[498]</sup></a> After Eaton
had examined the country around Quinnipiack, it was decided
to plant there, and seven men were left to guard the site during
the winter, the whole company following in the spring.
Not only were the resources of the colonists unusually ample,
but their preparations seem to have been exceptionally complete,
and the little town soon contained the most stately
dwellings in all New England. Some idea of their scale may
be gained from the reputed presence in Davenport's of thirteen
fireplaces, and of nineteen in Eaton's.<a id='r499'></a><a href='#f499' class='c014'><sup>[499]</sup></a> The intention,
apparently, was not only to found a Puritan state, but to have
it become the chief mercantile centre of the New World, which
accounts for their having built, as one of their Massachusetts
critics wrote, “as if trade and merchandize had been as inseparably
annexed to them as the shadow is to the body, in the
shining of the sun.”<a id='r500'></a><a href='#f500' class='c014'><sup>[500]</sup></a> One disaster followed another in their
business ventures, however, and the dreams of the merchant-founders
were never realized.</p>

<p class='c001'>Davenport and most of his company were not only Puritans,
but of the strictest sect, and the Bible Commonwealth which
they proceeded to form was of the most extreme type. Like
the Connecticut and Rhode Island people, they were without
a charter, and were mere squatters upon the soil; but in June,
1639, a meeting was held of the “free planters,” to discuss a
frame of government to replace a previously signed plantation
covenant, now lost. We have no knowledge of what
constituted a “free planter,” but the term undoubtedly excluded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>a large number of males in the settlement. The proceedings
took the form of queries put by Mr. Davenport, upon
which those present voted by raising hands. As a result of
unanimous votes at this meeting, the fundamental agreement
provided that the franchise should be restricted to church
members, and that the free planters should choose twelve men,
to whom should be intrusted the sole right of selecting from
among the rest of the colonists those who should become
church members and freemen, and who were to have the
power of appointing magistrates from among themselves, of
making and repealing laws, and, in fact, of performing all
public duties.<a id='r501'></a><a href='#f501' class='c014'><sup>[501]</sup></a> This was legalizing the most extreme claims
of the Massachusetts oligarchy. Only one voice, apparently
that of Eaton, was raised to protest “that free planters ought
not to give this power out of their hands”; but he was, of
course, overruled. Four months later, at the October court,
it was further voted that “the worde of God shall be the only
rule to be attended unto in ordering the affayres of government
in this plantation.”<a id='r502'></a><a href='#f502' class='c014'><sup>[502]</sup></a> As had been the case in Connecticut,
no mention had been made of allegiance to England;
but in this additional step, the new colony swept away all
obligation to observe the common and statute laws of the
mother-country. The conflicting texts of the Bible, as arbitrarily
chosen and interpreted by the small self-perpetuating
group of rulers, became the only laws that might safeguard,
or hazard, the rights of dwellers in New Haven and the affiliated
church-towns which soon sprang up. The reactionary
thought of the framers of these fundamental orders, however,
was to be without appreciable influence upon the growth of
colonial political theory as then developing; for New Haven
was to have only a quarter of a century of independent but
unimportant life before being absorbed by Connecticut, while
a more and more democratic tendency was manifesting itself
in all the colonies, even in Massachusetts.</p>

<p class='c001'>The effects of the frontier life, and of the distance separating
England from her colonies, were already beginning to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>show themselves strongly. The semi-independent communities
which had been established in Rhode Island, Connecticut,
and New Haven were entirely without legal authority;
and the two latter, in their “constitutions,” had utterly ignored
the existence of any power outside of themselves. The
situation was not wholly overlooked in England, but as the
crisis in public affairs there was rapidly drawing near, the authorities
were helpless to interfere. A new demand for the
return of the Massachusetts charter, when flatly refused by
that colony in 1638,<a id='r503'></a><a href='#f503' class='c014'><sup>[503]</sup></a> could not be followed by any show of
force; and during the next twenty-two years—which were
those of the Civil War, the fall of the Stuart monarchy, and
the reign of Cromwell—the New England colonies pursued
their way almost wholly without reference to the power of
England.</p>

<p class='c001'>The influence of the frontier was being felt in their domestic
concerns as well. Although the most aggressively radical of
the inhabitants of Massachusetts had, perhaps, gone to the
other colonies, there to establish themselves in greater freedom,
the struggle of the citizens continued, nevertheless, against
the arbitrary power of their government. From the first, the
body of magistrates had acted in a judicial, as well as an executive,
capacity. The only rule by which they were guided is
indicated by a resolution in the General Court of 1636, which
provided that they should “determine all causes according to
the lawes nowe established, and where there is noe law, then
as neere the lawe of God as they can.”<a id='r504'></a><a href='#f504' class='c014'><sup>[504]</sup></a> As English law, in
many cases, was not justly applicable, and as, in others, it was
largely neglected, this really meant the comparatively few
laws already enacted in the colony, and the same arbitrary
selection and interpretation of Old Testament texts that we
have just noted in New Haven. As the magistrates acted
as both attorneys and judges, and as no appeals were permitted
from their decisions, no accused person had any protection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>against them. Anyone, therefore, who might be obnoxious to
the ruling powers on account of his views, could not hope for
justice; and the so-called trials of Mrs. Hutchinson, Wheelwright,
and other notable offenders, were, in reality, not trials
at all, but “relentless inquisitions used by the government
for the purpose of crushing opposition.”<a id='r505'></a><a href='#f505' class='c014'><sup>[505]</sup></a> That condition
was not, indeed, peculiar to Massachusetts, and was probably
just as true of contemporary England. It was Hooker's glory
in Connecticut to have raised his voice, as the leader of that
colony, to plead for a legal restraint upon this arbitrary exercise
of the judicial power of government, and for the creation
of a body of fundamental law. In 1639, a committee was appointed
in that colony for the purpose of drawing up such a
code. The same had been formally demanded in Massachusetts
even earlier, but there the wishes of the people had been
steadily opposed by their leaders.</p>

<p class='c001'>While the Massachusetts trials of the type just noted were
exceptional, and in general, when passions were not aroused,
the ordinary course of justice was fairly equitable, nevertheless,
the entire absence of any restraint upon the unbridled
will of the magistrates was a source of apprehension to the
more serious thinking and liberty-loving residents of Massachusetts,
outside the ring of authority. Not only was any
opposition to the course pursued by the government liable to
result in banishment, with the complete uprooting of a man's
life, and perhaps the financial ruin of himself and his family,
but in trivial matters all the inhabitants, and more particularly,
of course, the four fifths who were not church members,
were liable to constant interference by the authorities. Such
a law, for example, as that declaring that whosoever should
“spend his time idlely or unproffitably” should suffer such
penalty “as the court shall thinke meete to inflicte”<a id='r506'></a><a href='#f506' class='c014'><sup>[506]</sup></a> was
typical, both in its utter lack of definition of the nature of the
crime, and in its failure to specify the penalty to be incurred
by the criminal.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>In spite of the demands of the people in Massachusetts,
however, it was not until 1640 that a draft of a fundamental
law seems to have really been considered. The clergy and
most of the magistrates had been opposed to any limitation of
arbitrary authority, and had fought the requests with what
their modern defender has called the weapon of “a good-natured
procrastination,” but which may have worn another
aspect to some at the time.<a id='r507'></a><a href='#f507' class='c014'><sup>[507]</sup></a> Finally, in 1641, an Abstract of
Laws, or Body of Liberties, was passed, which marked a distinct
step forward, though by no means assuring full protection.
One draft, which was not, however, accepted, was
based entirely upon Bible texts, of which, characteristically,
but two were drawn from the New Testament and forty-six
from the Old.<a id='r508'></a><a href='#f508' class='c014'><sup>[508]</sup></a> Additional safeguards were required, and four
years later, the whole discussion as to specific penalties for
specific offenses was again reopened. The clergy and Winthrop
still opposed any limitation upon judicial authority, the
Governor, indeed, going so far as to say that God had made
specific penalties only in certain cases, and as “judges are Gods
upon earth,” their power should not be more limited than his—which
might be denominated strong doctrine.<a id='r509'></a><a href='#f509' class='c014'><sup>[509]</sup></a> In spite
of all opposition, however, a new code, based in part upon the
Body of Liberties, was finally secured and printed in 1648,
twenty years after the first demand, and ten after Hooker's
famous sermon at Hartford.<a id='r510'></a><a href='#f510' class='c014'><sup>[510]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The antagonism to the power of the magistrates was manifested
also by new episodes in the struggle between them and
the more democratic deputies, which we noted as beginning
at the time of the Connecticut emigration. A dispute over
the ownership of a sow, between a poor widow and a rich man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>notorious for his unjust business dealings, was finally brought
to the General Court for decision. The evidence was by no
means convincing, and the Court was divided, with a majority
of the magistrates in favor of a verdict for the rich Keaynes,
and a majority of the deputies in favor of the poor widow.
The point was thus raised again as to whether the small number
of magistrates, by a negative vote, could block the will of the
much larger body of deputies.<a id='r511'></a><a href='#f511' class='c014'><sup>[511]</sup></a> Winthrop wrote a treatise on
the question, appealing to certain English precedents and the
Old Testament, and stated that, if the magistrates were not
allowed to veto the action of the deputies, the colony would
be a democracy and “there was no such government in Israel.”<a id='r512'></a><a href='#f512' class='c014'><sup>[512]</sup></a>
So implacably did the grim shades of Moses and Aaron block
the paths of Boston Common. The magistrates, in view of
the strong opposition that developed, offered to leave the
matter to the clergy, and to give way if the decision were
adverse. They knew, of course, that it would not be so, and
Winthrop records that it was “their only care to gain time,”
until the people could be brought to the heel of their clerical
leaders as usual. As part of the plan, the members of the
Court were asked to take advice before the next meeting; and
it is interesting as showing the normal danger for the ordinary
citizen in discussing public matters, that a special act should
be thought necessary making it “no offence for any, either
publicly or privately, to declare their opinion in the case, so
it were modestly.”<a id='r513'></a><a href='#f513' class='c014'><sup>[513]</sup></a> The following year, a compromise was
effected, which, however, was distinctly in favor of the magistrates;
and thereafter the deputies and the magistrates sat as
two separate houses, each with a negative vote on the other.<a id='r514'></a><a href='#f514' class='c014'><sup>[514]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Another incident in the struggle, which soon occurred, involved
both the question of the power of the local government
over the colonists, and the relations of the colony to the home
government in England. In 1644, it was suggested to the
General Court that the condition of the large number of unrepresented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>inhabitants be improved by increasing the civil
privileges that a citizen might possess without being a church
member, such privileges then being limited, apparently, to a
small share in local town business.<a id='r515'></a><a href='#f515' class='c014'><sup>[515]</sup></a> Nothing, however, was
done, and two years later, a petition signed by a Dr. Robert
Child, Samuel Maverick, and five others was presented, reciting
that there were many thousands in the colony who
were debarred from all participation in government, although
they paid taxes and were subject to military and other duties.
Child was a newcomer, “a gentleman and a scholar,” and
a graduate of the University of Padua. Maverick was the
richest of the “old planters,” and the only freeman who was
not a church member—a privilege which he owed to the
circumstances connected with the first planting of the colony,
as already related. Thomas Fowle, another of the signers,
was a merchant; while yet another, David Yale, was a man
of property, and both a stepson of Theophilus Eaton of
New Haven and a brother-in-law of Governor Hopkins of
Connecticut. At this very time, he was acting as attorney for
the Earl of Warwick.<a id='r516'></a><a href='#f516' class='c014'><sup>[516]</sup></a> The motives of the signers may not
have been wholly disinterested, but the effort to make out
that they were persons of no importance in the colony has
been overdone.<a id='r517'></a><a href='#f517' class='c014'><sup>[517]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The petitioners desired that “members of the church of
England, not scandalous in their lives and conversations,” be
admitted to the churches, and that “civil liberty and freedom
be forthwith granted to all truly English, equall to the rest of
their countrymen, as in all plantations is accustomed to be
done, and as all freeborne enjoy in our native country.”<a id='r518'></a><a href='#f518' class='c014'><sup>[518]</sup></a>
Other reforms were demanded, and although some of the
charges were overdrawn, nevertheless, the main point was not
fairly met in the lengthy reply prepared by Winthrop, Dudley,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>and others of the court.<a id='r519'></a><a href='#f519' class='c014'><sup>[519]</sup></a> That point was that in an English
colony, and upon English soil, the great majority of the inhabitants
were debarred from a share in the government because
of beliefs which would not have so disfranchised them in the
home country. No amount of legal casuistry expended upon
the charter, and no amount of sophistry employed in explaining
the relations between the colony and England, could alter
that fact, nor the additional one that Massachusetts was a
colony and not an independent nation. As the request of the
petitioners was for such liberties only as they would have possessed
at home, and not for general religious toleration, an
appeal to England was natural, and was set on foot as soon
as the reply of the magistrates was received. Winthrop, however,
declared that he would not tolerate such an appeal, and
the petitioners were heavily fined by the court, and two of
them imprisoned.<a id='r520'></a><a href='#f520' class='c014'><sup>[520]</sup></a> Child, and some of the others insisting
upon going to England, they were seized just before the ship
sailed, their baggage and houses were searched, and they themselves
imprisoned. As some of the magistrates had not agreed
to the earlier proceedings, they were not consulted in the present
one, which was distinctly of a Star-Chamber sort. Among
the papers of Dand, another signer, was found one suggesting
the appointment of a royal governor, for which he also was
promptly put in jail. Vassall and Fowle finally reached England;
but the political situation there by 1647 had become such
as to preclude any consideration of colonial matters.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>The tide of popular rights in the colonies was rising, however,
and “all the troubles of New England” were “not at the
Massachusetts,” as Winslow wrote to Winthrop, nor were high-handed
proceedings wholly limited to that commonwealth.
In Plymouth, a written proposal, favored by many of the inhabitants
and of the deputies, was presented to the General
Court, “to allow and maintaine full and free tollerance of religion
to all men that would preserve the civill peace and submit
unto government.” “You would have admired [wondered]
to have seen,” wrote Winslow, “how sweet this carrion
relished to the pallate of most of the deputies.” “Notwithstanding
it was required, according to order, to be voted,”
the Governor would not permit any vote to be taken; and
the effort thus to extend to others the same freedom that the
leading founders of the colony had availed themselves of for
twelve years in Holland was summarily suppressed.<a id='r521'></a><a href='#f521' class='c014'><sup>[521]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>During the decade we have been considering, the struggle of
Englishmen at home for the preservation of their liberties
against the incompetent and reactionary rule of the second
Stuart, had left that ruler but little leisure to consider the
American colonies. Except for occasional and ineffectual
efforts to retain some control over them by the home government,
they had been left free to work out their own theories,
untrammeled by any higher power. By 1640, the scattered
settlements in Maine, the towns in New Hampshire, the Bay
Colony, Plymouth, the four separate towns in what is now
Rhode Island, Saybrook, the affiliated towns of New Haven,
and the river settlements of Connecticut, were pursuing their
several ways virtually as independent states, preëmpting lands,
erecting governments, treating with the natives, with each
other, and with the French and Dutch, as if they were sovereign
powers. Nor was there anything to prevent innumerable
other petty states, each with its few square miles of territory,
and ruling according to its own ideas, from arising over all
New England, save as restrained by the jealousy of those already
in existence. If this tendency had not been restrained,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>New England might have come in time to be a checker-board
of tiny republics, engaged in constant disputes over boundaries
and other relations at home, and, should the shield of England
cease to protect them, the prey of foreign foes abroad.</p>

<p class='c001'>There were three possible methods of preventing this development
of a Puritan Balkans. England might assert her
rights legitimately, and endeavor to bring some sort of uniformity
and order out of what might otherwise become an
impossible situation; one or another of the colonies might,
by force of greater strength, subdue its weaker neighbors,
and thus create one or several greater states; or, finally, a
confederation might be formed of all of them. Under the
circumstances, the legal and logical method would have been
some sort of imperial control by the mother-country, but that
was out of the question unless the English government was
strong and united enough to enforce her will, and wise and
experienced enough to make it acceptable to the colonists.
For the present, that solution was impossible. Of the other
two, the first would naturally appeal to a strong and aggressive
colony like Massachusetts, while a confederacy would
be favored by her weaker but no less independent neighbors.
Both the latter plans were tried, and the intercolonial relations
of the next quarter of a century were largely the result
of these two conflicting methods of unifying New England
being pursued simultaneously.</p>

<p class='c001'>Owing to the death of Mason, and the failure of Gorges's
plans for Maine, the settlements north of Massachusetts were
without a settled government, and the inhabitants do not
seem to have had the ability to create a stable one for themselves,
which was so marked a characteristic of those in Massachusetts
and Plymouth, Connecticut and New Haven. We
have already seen how Massachusetts, by an unwarrantable
construction of her charter, had begun to lay claim to all the
land of New Hampshire and Maine lying eastward of the most
northerly source of the Merrimack, although the whole course
of the Crown and Council for New England at the time of the
grant showed that such a claim was absolutely untenable.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>Nor, in the beginning, had the Massachusetts leaders dreamed
of making it,<a id='r522'></a><a href='#f522' class='c014'><sup>[522]</sup></a> and it was, in fact, as Professor Osgood says,
“more clearly an usurpation than was any later act of the
crown which affected New England.”<a id='r523'></a><a href='#f523' class='c014'><sup>[523]</sup></a> The decision, otherwise
favorable to Massachusetts, of the English Chief Justices
in 1677, declaring the interpretation claimed to be utterly
without warrant, and reassigning the lands to the heirs of the
two original patentees, seems entirely just.<a id='r524'></a><a href='#f524' class='c014'><sup>[524]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Early in 1641, a dispute between church factions in Dover,
headed by two contending clergymen, gave Massachusetts a
chance to intervene. Captain Underhill, who had been banished
from that colony at the time of the Hutchinson controversy,
was then on the Piscataqua, and, perhaps with an idea
of once more ingratiating himself with the home authorities,
sent a petition to the Massachusetts Court, asking aid for
himself and his party. Massachusetts at once dispatched a
magistrate and two clergymen, and the Underhill party were
victorious, the clergyman heading the opposing faction having
opportunely turned out to be a personally immoral character.<a id='r525'></a><a href='#f525' class='c014'><sup>[525]</sup></a>
The Dover patentees, Warwick, Say, and the others, who
had purchased the patent in the interests of Massachusetts
some years before, now passed the grant, with slight reservations,
to that colony, which at once annexed the town.<a id='r526'></a><a href='#f526' class='c014'><sup>[526]</sup></a> A
temporary government was installed, and, two years later, it
was agreed that the inhabitants should have the privilege of
freemen to manage their local affairs, and to elect deputies,
even though they were not church members.<a id='r527'></a><a href='#f527' class='c014'><sup>[527]</sup></a> Thus a right
not yielded to four fifths of her own citizens was granted to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>those in her new possessions, and imperial ambition seems to
have won the first victory over Israelitish polity. This provision
not only disproved her former claim that civil order
could not be maintained without forced religious conformity,
but, combined with the further provision that the settlers
in the newly annexed territory should be subject only to
local, and not to general, taxation, it tended to show that she
herself did not believe the claims she made as to the interpretation
of the charter.<a id='r528'></a><a href='#f528' class='c014'><sup>[528]</sup></a> If she really considered that the territory
now being seized under pretext of ownership was as indubitably
hers as that south of the Merrimack, why did she
thus deprive herself of the right of religious and fiscal control?</p>

<p class='c001'>She next claimed and absorbed the town of Exeter, and her
new claims, extending to Maine, there came into conflict with
those of Gorges and the Pilgrims. The latter, indeed, had
lately heard her state that she was entitled to a part of the
town of Plymouth itself, and she did encroach upon the Plymouth
territory.<a id='r529'></a><a href='#f529' class='c014'><sup>[529]</sup></a> A further enlargement of her power to the
south, and one obviously outside her jurisdiction, was next
made within the present limits of Rhode Island.</p>

<p class='c001'>Samuel Gorton, from his heretical notions in religion, according
to the Gospel of New England, and his somewhat
explosive efforts to defend persons he thought oppressed by
the colonial authorities, had led a troubled and troubling life
in Massachusetts, Plymouth, Portsmouth, and Providence.
Indeed, in his wandering course through the Puritan heavens,
he seems to have been as fatally followed by trouble as a
comet by its luminous tail. As he punctuated his career by
denominating the Massachusetts magistrates “a generation
of vipers,” the Governor of Plymouth, “Satan,” and the justice
of Portsmouth, “a just-ass,” he can hardly be said to have
had an ingratiating way with the authorities, although no
crime could be laid at his door. The people of that day had
an insatiable passion for ploughing in the theological field,
which was always proving as full of unexploded shells as any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>on the modern battle-front of France, and Gorton seems to
have had a fatal facility for turning these up. He had already
been blown out of three colonies, when, after some experience
with him, the men of Providence decided that he or they must
leave. Finally banished, he made an Indian purchase, and
settled some miles to the south.</p>

<p class='c001'>This, however, was not far enough for his former neighbors,
who, in 1641, asked assistance from Massachusetts in ridding
them of Gorton. That colony refused to consider the request,
unless Providence would place herself under her jurisdiction.<a id='r530'></a><a href='#f530' class='c014'><sup>[530]</sup></a>
The matter became complicated by a dispute between Miantanomo
and two other sachems, arising out of Gorton's purchase,
and the sachems also applied to Massachusetts. Both
they and the Providence men were received under her jurisdiction,
and the next move was to send a force of forty armed
men to take Gorton and his party into custody.<a id='r531'></a><a href='#f531' class='c014'><sup>[531]</sup></a> Even those
opposed to him in Providence suggested arbitration; but the
Massachusetts clergy advised the magistrates that this was not
an “honorable” course, as the Gorton party “were no state,
but a few fugitives living without law or government,” and
“their blasphemous and reviling writings” could be “purged
away only by repentence and public satisfaction.”<a id='r532'></a><a href='#f532' class='c014'><sup>[532]</sup></a> The case
was, therefore, prejudged without a hearing, and the more
summary method was taken of trying to set fire to the log
fort in which Gorton and his company had taken refuge.</p>

<p class='c001'>It must be presumed that the ministers of Christ considered
this as a more “honorable” course than arbitration with
“a few fugitives” from their vindictiveness. The attack was
made on a Sabbath morning, and even the heretical Gorton
was naturally surprised.<a id='r533'></a><a href='#f533' class='c014'><sup>[533]</sup></a> In receiving the Indians under
their jurisdiction, Massachusetts had required that the savages
should not profane that day by doing any work upon it, and
that they should not kill any man but upon just cause and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>authority.<a id='r534'></a><a href='#f534' class='c014'><sup>[534]</sup></a> The attempt, immediately following, on the part
of that colony's expedition, to burn their fellow white men
alive during church hours, because they were too impatient
to wait, may have struck their new savage subjects as a little
incongruous. Nine of the Gortonists were captured, taken to
Boston, and imprisoned. The clergy called for blood, and
gave their written opinion that all nine of the prisoners “deserved
death by the law of God.” In this unjust and inhuman
decision, all the magistrates but three concurred, and it was
prevented from passing only by the people's representatives
among the deputies. Finally, the prisoners were condemned
to be distributed among seven towns, there to be “kept to
worke for their living, and wear irons upon one leg, and not
to depart the limits of the town, nor by word or writing maintain
any of their blasphemous or wicked errors upon pain
of death.”<a id='r535'></a><a href='#f535' class='c014'><sup>[535]</sup></a> The sentence was executed and the prisoners
were kept in irons until the following year; when the growing
popular disapproval of the clergy's actions caused their victims
to be suddenly released and banished.<a id='r536'></a><a href='#f536' class='c014'><sup>[536]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Massachusetts authorities had thus utilized the request
of one faction in a settlement wholly outside their own limits,
to extend their jurisdiction. They had attempted, upon a
charge of heresy directed against persons living in another
colony, to murder the entire body of the opposing faction,
after refusing the arbitration proposed by that faction's own
enemies. When the decree was finally softened to banishment,
this was held to include exclusion of the prisoners from their
former homes, now considered as part of the Bay Colony.
They had seized and sold the cattle and goods of the unfortunate
people, to pay the expenses of their so-called trial and
illegal detention. In all this, there had not been even the
fallacious plea, as in the case of Williams and Mrs. Hutchinson,
that the civil peace of Massachusetts had been endangered.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>The outcome showed, however, that the cruel and immoral
power of the clergy and magistrates was coming to be opposed
by a growing body of healthy and liberal opinion. The
bloody sentence demanded by them had been refused by the
people's leaders, and public opinion had finally secured the
reversal, within a year, of the milder one that had been executed.
The confusion of Gorton's own religious views, and
his incoherence in expressing them, could in themselves have
won him little popular support.<a id='r537'></a><a href='#f537' class='c014'><sup>[537]</sup></a> What the people were
groping after was the right of the individual to think and act
for himself, so long as the state was not endangered, as had
been clearly expressed in the Plymouth petition. The road
was to be long and bloodstained, but there was now no doubt
that the people of Massachusetts intended to travel it, and
that their feet were at last set in the right direction.</p>

<p class='c001'>By 1640, although new arrivals had not been coming in so
rapidly of late, the population of the New England settlements
had grown to about eighteen thousand. Moreover, they had,
on the whole, been prosperous. We have already seen how
even Plymouth, with its slender resources, its poor soil, and
its ill-chosen site, had yet achieved more than economic independence,
and we have noted the financial resources of New
Haven. The capital and numbers of Massachusetts were, of
course, far larger than those of either of the others, and it was
estimated that that colony had spent, in its first dozen years,
nearly £200,000, or in our day, perhaps, five million dollars, in
making its settlement.<a id='r538'></a><a href='#f538' class='c014'><sup>[538]</sup></a> Possessed of the unrestricted resources
of a continent, and having suffered no losses from Indians
or foreign foe, New England was apparently in a sound
economic condition, when suddenly the crash came. “Merchants
would sell no wares but for ready money,” Winthrop
wrote in 1640; “men could not pay their debts though they
had enough, prices of lands and cattle fell soon to the one-half,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>yea to a third, and after one-fourth part.”<a id='r539'></a><a href='#f539' class='c014'><sup>[539]</sup></a> The Massachusetts
General Court was soon called upon to pass special
legislation to assist debtors, as the suffering became general.</p>

<p class='c001'>In spite of their enormous natural resources, the colonies,
like all new countries, lacked capital in the form of money.
They borrowed heavily from England and imported from her
still more heavily in food, clothes, and manufactured goods,
without as yet having developed sufficient export trade to
enable them to meet their foreign bills.<a id='r540'></a><a href='#f540' class='c014'><sup>[540]</sup></a> The inherent unsoundness
of the position had been concealed, temporarily, by
the effects of the continued influx of new settlers on a large
scale, which had created a demand for all the colonists' surplus
in the shape of everything required by a planter during his
first years. Prices of both goods and lands advanced steadily,
as a fire is blown into flame by a forced draught. Suddenly the
tide of immigration stopped entirely; the exceptional demand,
which had come to be regarded as normal, ceased; English
merchants naturally required payment on overdue accounts;
and all the familiar phenomena of an economic crisis became
evident.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is usually stated that emigration from England stopped
because the prospect there had become so much brighter for
the Puritans that there was no longer reason for leaving home.<a id='r541'></a><a href='#f541' class='c014'><sup>[541]</sup></a>
This, however, by no means meets all the requirements of the
case. We have already seen that the great majority of the
people who had been coming to New England had not joined
the churches there, although in the main of Puritan stock.
Nor, at the time in question, did the Puritan leaders in England,
in spite of altered conditions, by any means relax their
efforts to plant Puritan colonies. In fact, such men as Say
and Pym were more enthusiastic than ever in their plans.
These efforts, however, were no longer directed toward New
England, but in quite other directions.<a id='r542'></a><a href='#f542' class='c014'><sup>[542]</sup></a> By her religious persecutions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>and peculiar church-membership requirement for the
franchise, Massachusetts had, little by little, antagonized all
her old friends at home, from the Earl of Warwick down, who
had been constantly calling the attention of her leaders to the
fact that no more people, not even Puritans, would go to her
if she did not discontinue her career of persecution. By that
course she had already virtually excluded from her portion of
the English Empire all Englishmen not acceptable to her clergy
and a dozen of her leading laymen. This closed her ports to
almost the entire stream of English emigration, which continued
large, although somewhat changed in character, while
the labor of her former friends was now expended in diverting
what remained of the Puritan element itself in that stream
away from, instead of toward, Massachusetts.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this connection, Winthrop wrote bitterly to Lord Say,
complaining of his efforts to induce settlers to go out from
England to the Caribbean instead of to New England. To
this, Say made a long reply, rebuking the authorities in the
colony for their misuse of Scripture texts to further their
own views, and ended with the admonition that “for what
you say of the church not compatable with another frame
of government, I pray putt away that error ... the church
beinge wholly spirritual, can subsist with any forme of outward
government.”<a id='r543'></a><a href='#f543' class='c014'><sup>[543]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Not only, however, did immigration to Massachusetts stop,
but there threatened to be an emigration from that colony to
the English leaders' Caribbean settlement. John Humphrey,
one of the most influential of the original planters, who had
not prospered in the Bay, was made Governor of the West
Indian Puritan settlements, and, in 1641, sailed thither with
several hundred Massachusetts people.<a id='r544'></a><a href='#f544' class='c014'><sup>[544]</sup></a> Many others removed
to other colonies, and Winthrop relates, with evident
relish, the misfortunes which befell them as God's judgment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>upon them for leaving.<a id='r545'></a><a href='#f545' class='c014'><sup>[545]</sup></a> That the influences checking the
growth of Massachusetts were not wholly due to general conditions
is indicated also by the fact that, while her population,
in the next two decades, was considerably less than doubled,
that of New Hampshire was nearly tripled, Rhode Island increased
five-fold, and Connecticut four-fold.<a id='r546'></a><a href='#f546' class='c014'><sup>[546]</sup></a> The actual
numbers are even more striking than the percentages. Massachusetts,
starting the period with fourteen thousand, added
less than ten thousand, while the other three, beginning with
but three thousand, added nearly nine thousand. Connecticut's
growth, moreover, was made in spite of the fact that
apparently Massachusetts made even greater efforts to divert
emigrants from that colony than were being made in England
to divert them from herself; so that Hooker, in complaining
of the methods employed by her citizens, was forced to write
to Winthrop, that “such impudent forgery is scant found in
hell.”<a id='r547'></a><a href='#f547' class='c014'><sup>[547]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In the absence of any attempt by England to unify these
scattered settlements, the only tendency toward unification,
as against the centrifugal forces at work, had been the process
of annexation and attempted domination by Massachusetts.
The growth of the frontier, however, with the resultant Pequot
war, had fostered a sense of unity in the face of a common
danger among those exposed to it. As Professor Turner points
out, in speaking of the colonies in general, particularism was
always strongest in those not so exposed, and the Indian
frontier “stretched along the western border like a cord of
union.”<a id='r548'></a><a href='#f548' class='c014'><sup>[548]</sup></a> The extension, northward and westward, had also
brought the English into immediate and hostile contact with
both French and Dutch. Apparently as a result of the somewhat
inefficient joint action in the Pequot war, a confederation
between the colonies was informally discussed at Boston
in 1637, and a draft prepared by Massachusetts the following
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>year.<a id='r549'></a><a href='#f549' class='c014'><sup>[549]</sup></a> Connecticut objected to one of the terms, the ground
of her dislike, Winthrop wrote, being her “shyness of coming
under our government.”<a id='r550'></a><a href='#f550' class='c014'><sup>[550]</sup></a> The smaller colony, however,
had, within a few years, so far got over her shyness as to be
ready to “entertain a firm combination for a defensive and
offensive war, and all other mutual offices of love,” as the
records somewhat quaintly word it.<a id='r551'></a><a href='#f551' class='c014'><sup>[551]</sup></a> The decrease in immigration,
and the business panic throughout the colonies, may
have helped to bring them to a more realizing sense of their
isolation from England, and of the need of mutual dependence,
which was greatly increased by a threatened renewal of Indian
hostilities in 1642. The latter is the sole reason given by
Bradford for the remarkable effort now made to combine the
colonies into a confederation, in regard to which all our contemporary
authorities are singularly silent.<a id='r552'></a><a href='#f552' class='c014'><sup>[552]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The settlements, however, were well fitted to be thus joined
in closer bonds, in spite of minor differences. The country
in which they were planted formed a geographical unit, the
natural boundaries of which were emphasized by the human
elements of hostile French, Indians, and Dutch. The economic
and social life, based upon the geographical, religious, and
political factors, was, in the main, remarkably homogeneous.
Their attitude toward English policy, and their trade-relations
with the rest of the empire, were very similar. There was
not only no such clashing of interests as divided them from
the staple colonies of the West Indies, but not even the minor
differences that would have made impossible such a combination
between Pennsylvania and Virginia. United action in
the Indian war, and the religious Synod of the same year, had
been the first steps taken in the formation of the political
machinery for consideration of joint affairs. The way was
smoothly paved, therefore, for the establishment of a genuine
<a id='corr225.33'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='union'>union.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_225.33'><ins class='correction' title='union'>union.</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c001'>There was, however, one stumbling-block, which was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>intense local feeling and exaggerated sense of importance of
the separate settlements. The leaders in each of them must
often have dreamed of what the future might have in store
for the little colonies in which they had cast their lots, but
it is impossible to say what those dreams may have been.
They could not have included the actual development of the
present British Empire or of the United States, the creation
of each of which has been largely dependent upon economic
forces and scientific inventions beyond the vision of any seventeenth-century
mind. Whatever their dreams may have been,
in practice the leaders adopted an opportunist policy, which,
in general, may be described as the endeavor to keep from
being entangled with England without losing the value of her
protection. That any of them could seriously have thought
that their individual colonies, as such, could ever become powerful
nations, is unlikely. Added, therefore, to their policy regarding
England was probably an opportunist policy regarding
their neighbors. The extent and nature of the New England
country had, by this time, become fairly well known, and
the rate of growth could be more or less accurately forecast.
With extending frontiers and but ill-defined territorial limits,
disputes, already occurring, could also be foreseen as bound to
become more frequent and more serious.</p>

<p class='c001'>All of the colonies had shown the tendency toward expansion.
Plymouth had started her trading posts on the rivers
of Maine and Connecticut; settlements multiplied in Rhode
Island; New Haven, from the meadows of Quinnipiack, was
soon planting on Long Island, and nearing the Dutch boundaries
on the Sound; while Connecticut, through her purchase
of Saybrook from the disappointed patentees in 1644,<a id='r553'></a><a href='#f553' class='c014'><sup>[553]</sup></a> and her
planting of towns westward even of New Haven's expansion,
was rapidly stretching east and west. Massachusetts had
long adopted the definite policy of extending her claims and
control as fast and as far as possible. In the race for land and
power, her numbers, resources, and central position, all gave
her immense advantages, to which was added the no mean
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>one of an unscrupulous disregard for the prior rights of others.
On the one hand, then, the weaker colonies might hope to gain
from union some protection, not only from the Indian and the
foreigner, but from the growing aggressiveness of Massachusetts.
On the other, that colony might anticipate dominating
the councils of the Confederacy, while free scope was still left
for her own aggrandizement.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although they were far inferior to her as military powers,
the acknowledgment of Plymouth, Connecticut, and New
Haven as of equal political weight in the Union served largely
to protect them against the Bay Colony; but there was no
such protection for Maine or for the towns in Rhode Island,
which were refused admission to the league. The inhabitants
of the former were not received, Winthrop wrote, because the
people of Agamenticus had recently “made a taylor their
mayor, and had entertained one Hull, an excommunicated
person, and very contentious, for their minister.”<a id='r554'></a><a href='#f554' class='c014'><sup>[554]</sup></a> These
somewhat surprising reasons for refusing representation to the
few inhabitants of a territory equal in size to all the rest of
New England combined may be dismissed as not the true ones.
We are more likely to find the latter in that new interpretation
of her charter by which Massachusetts laid claim to all this
vast tract, which she formally annexed ten years later. To
have allowed its inhabitants representation in the proposed
confederacy would have been to acknowledge their right
to be considered an independent colony, and so would have
placed awkward moral obstacles in the way of the manifest
destiny of God's elect. In regard to the Rhode Island plantations,
in spite of Winthrop's affection for Williams, the Bay
Colony had always exhibited a vindictive spite, the extreme
virulence of which it is somewhat difficult to understand, even
after making all allowances for the known facts. In 1640,
under the administration of Dudley, the Massachusetts General
Court had received a letter from the magistrates of Connecticut,
New Haven, and Aquidneck, “wherein they declared
their dislike of such as would have the Indians rooted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>out,” and their desire of “seeking to gain them by justice and
kindness,” although carefully watching them for any hostile
intent. While the Massachusetts Court voted its assent, it
also insisted that the answer should be addressed only to the
magistrates of Connecticut and New Haven, formally excluding
any communication with those of Aquidneck “as men not
to bee capitulated withall by us, either for themselves or the
people of the iland where they inhabit.”<a id='r555'></a><a href='#f555' class='c014'><sup>[555]</sup></a> Silly bigotry, as
well as intercolonial discourtesy, could hardly go further than
in this childish refusal even to discuss a humanitarian project
of importance and of common interest. The real motive, however,
may have been, as in the case of Maine, to leave the way
open to annexation by refusing to acknowledge any separate
government; and when, a year after the confederacy was formed,
the Rhode Island towns applied for admission, the answer, undoubtedly
dictated by Massachusetts, was an “utter refusall”
unless they would “absolutely and without reservacon submitt”
to either Plymouth or herself.<a id='r556'></a><a href='#f556' class='c014'><sup>[556]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>At the time of the formation of the Confederacy, Massachusetts
had just driven the entering wedge at Providence and
absorbed New Hampshire, and was engaged in encroaching
upon the northern bounds of Plymouth and Connecticut. The
three smaller colonies, therefore, had everything to gain by
having their existence recognized by being admitted as political
equals in the league; while they were further protected by the
third clause in the Articles, which guaranteed the independence
of each of them, and even forbade the voluntary union
of any colony with another without consent of the Confederation.
On the other hand, Massachusetts, with the rich territories
to the north and south—which she was already absorbing—left
open to her, had also much to gain by having
a body that could give some sort of legal approval to her illegal
poachings; and her own power, in extreme circumstances, could
be counted upon to nullify any adverse vote. These were probably
the reasons which induced her to enter a Confederation in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>which her two commissioners had only an equal voting power
with those of each of the three smaller colonies in the governing
board of eight.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although the Articles of Confederation agreed that the four
colonies should thereafter be known as the United Colonies
of New England, the machinery set up was not that of a genuine
federal state, but simply that of “a firme and perpetual
league of friendship and amity for offence and defence, mutual
advice and succor.”<a id='r557'></a><a href='#f557' class='c014'><sup>[557]</sup></a> Even the very moderate powers granted
the board of commissioners, which constituted the only organ
of the league, tended to decline, and it can hardly be considered
as other than a joint committee to consider matters of
mutual interest and to proffer advice to the general courts of
the several colonies. According to the Articles, however, the
commissioners, when they met at the regular annual meetings,
were to be possessed of full authority from their home courts
to determine all military matters, it being provided that no
colony should engage in either offensive or defensive war without
the consent of at least six of the eight commissioners. This
was the majority required to decide all other questions, and
in case six could not agree, the matter in dispute was to be
referred back to the general courts.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Confederation, which no more recognized the existence
of England than the “constitutions” of Connecticut and New
Haven had done, possessed no means of operating directly
upon the people as individuals, or of enforcing its will upon a
recalcitrant colony. It was a useful piece of machinery, but
not a new government, and it failed to call forth affection
or loyalty from its members. It is impossible to say what it
might have developed into had the colonies remained permanently
as independent of England as they were until the restoration
of the Stuarts in 1660. The various results of that
event did away, in time, with the possibility, or the necessity,
of such an organization. But, during the Union's existence,
it performed valuable service, not merely in accustoming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>the colonies to act together, but also in concentrating their
resources in military emergencies, and, negatively, in saving
the smaller members from the encroachments of Massachusetts.
As was inevitable, that colony largely dominated its
councils, and the attitude that the commissioners adopted
upon questions of civil and religious polity was, in the main,
that of Massachusetts rather than that of Plymouth or Connecticut.
In all that concerned the liberty of the individual, the
weight of their authority was, as a rule, thrown upon the side
of reaction, rather than of progress. The small extent of
their real powers, however, is indicated by the fact that the
history of New England under the Confederacy continued to
be the history of Massachusetts and her neighbors, and not
that of the “United Colonies of New England.”</p>

Prof. G. L. Kittredge has recently written an elaborate account of Dr. Child—"Doctor
Robert Child the Remonstrant," reprinted from <cite>Publications, Col. Soc.,
Mass.</cite>, 1919. It is a strong brief in defense of the action taken by the Massachusetts
authorities, and contains the fullest and most accurate account of the Petition and
the subsequent trials yet written. Prof. Kittredge is a firm supporter of the old
theory that Child was plotting to overthrow the government in the interests of Presbyterianism.
While this may be so, it seems not to cover the cases of the other remonstrants.
The main interest of the affair for our present work, however, lies in
the evidence afforded of discontent with the Puritan regime, and in that connection,
Prof. Kittredge, after showing the extreme diversity of views held by the signers on
most matters, speaks of “their discontent with the administration which was the sole
binding element common to all the Remonstrants” (p. 29). He also states (p. 52),
that “there was more or less public sentiment in favor of the defendants.”</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER X <br> <br> CROSS-CURRENTS IN THE CONFEDERACY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>From the formation of the Confederacy in 1643, until the
restoration of the English monarchy in 1660, the colonies were
practically free to make what use they could of an entire
liberty of action, unhampered by any serious attempt on the
part of the British government to interfere with them. The
whole situation was favorable. The settlements had passed
the experimental stage, and were well rooted. If the decline
in immigration entailed certain disadvantages, on the other
hand it relieved the existing order from the necessity of absorbing
new elements. The more powerful colonies had
signed articles of union, and no Indian war of any magnitude
was to interrupt their peaceful development. The economic
position slowly improved, and reached a sounder basis than
before. Yet the pages which record the story of those seventeen
years are among the least attractive in New England
history. There is hardly an incident to stir the imagination
or to fire a noble pride. Freed from all restraint, the best use
that the colonies could make of their liberty was to quarrel
among themselves over boundaries, annexations, and taxes; to
contend, without honor, with the Dutch and French; to carry
on inglorious controversies with the savages; and to indulge
in the only example of bloody religious persecution that the
United States has known. Looking at the history of those
years, however, from the standpoint of the development of
personal liberty, there were two movements that redeem its
otherwise disheartening aspects. One was the bringing of order
out of chaos in Rhode Island, where the settlers proved that
democracy and a broad toleration could, after all, be combined
with political stability. The other was the success of
the people of Massachusetts in securing the fundamental body
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>of laws already noted, and the unmistakable rejection of their
theocratical leaders, lay and clerical.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the return of Acadia to France by the treaty of St. Germain,
one Claude de Razilly had been commissioned to rule
the territory; and after his death, three years later, d'Aulnay
and de la Tour, both of whom had possessed grants and
trading posts within his jurisdiction, aspired to replace him in
the supreme command.<a id='r558'></a><a href='#f558' class='c014'><sup>[558]</sup></a> After various encounters, in one of
which d'Aulnay captured de la Tour, the latter, in 1643, arrived
at Boston with one hundred and forty men, and asked
for help against his rival. Winthrop, who was then governor,
called together a few of the magistrates and deputies, who assured
de la Tour that, although they could not grant him aid
officially, he might have permission to hire ships and engage
volunteers for his expedition.<a id='r559'></a><a href='#f559' class='c014'><sup>[559]</sup></a> “The rumour of these things
soon spreading,” however, they encountered so much adverse
criticism that Winthrop consulted with additional members of
the Court, and, of course, the clergy. The question was long
debated, whether it was lawful for Christians to aid idolaters,
and, somewhat more pertinently, whether it was expedient in
this particular case. The debate is given at length by Winthrop,
and affords an instructive example of Puritan casuistry.
A matter of so much importance should, of course, have been
referred to the General Court, and, also, under the terms of the
new Confederacy, to the Commissioners of that body. The
Boston merchants, however, seem to have brought powerful
influences to bear, and the little job in dollar-diplomacy was
rushed through, regardless of obligations or consequences.
The question was not referred to the Court, Winthrop wrote,
because if it “had been assembled, we knew they would not
have given him aid without consent of the commissioners of
the other colonies, and for a bare permission, we might do it
without the court.”<a id='r560'></a><a href='#f560' class='c014'><sup>[560]</sup></a> Saltonstall and others afterwards wrote,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>strongly condemning the action, urging that the real rights
of the case had not been known, that wars involving the subjects
of another nation ought not to be undertaken without the
knowledge of the home government; and brushed away the
sophistical distinctions made by the Boston clique between
private permission by the colony's rulers and their official
sanction. “D'Aulnay, nor France,” they wrote, “are not so
feeble in their intellectuals as to deeme it no act of state.”<a id='r561'></a><a href='#f561' class='c014'><sup>[561]</sup></a></p>

<div id='i232'  class='figcenter id007'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Page from John Winthrop's Journal<br>  <span class='small'>Original in Massachusetts Historical Society</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The expedition, however, had been allowed to sail, carrying
a somewhat fatuous letter from Winthrop to d'Aulnay, stating
that the Massachusetts volunteers were, if possible, to effect
a reconciliation, that they possessed no commission, and that,
if they did anything “against the rules of justice and good-neighborhood,”
they should be held accountable.<a id='r562'></a><a href='#f562' class='c014'><sup>[562]</sup></a> In spite of
this, some of the men attacked d'Aulnay's plantation, burned
his mill, killed his cattle, and plundered one of his vessels of
beaver skins. The latter were brought back to Boston and
sold at auction, and the proceeds were divided among the soldiers.<a id='r563'></a><a href='#f563' class='c014'><sup>[563]</sup></a>
The enterprise had been neither successful, glorious, nor
profitable; and when de la Tour again applied for help, in
July of the following year, Endicott, who had opposed the original
participation of the colony, had succeeded Winthrop as
governor. The only result of de la Tour's suit, therefore,
was a proclamation of neutrality “till the next general court,”
and the dispatch of a letter to d'Aulnay offering satisfaction,
and likewise requesting it for his own earlier depredations
on the Penobscot.<a id='r564'></a><a href='#f564' class='c014'><sup>[564]</sup></a> In September, the Commissioners of
the United Colonies met and passed a resolution forbidding,
in future, such acts of volunteers as Massachusetts had connived
at.<a id='r565'></a><a href='#f565' class='c014'><sup>[565]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The struggle between the two rivals had not been limited
to fighting in America, but had been carried on at the French
Court, where each had striven for recognition. In this d'Aulnay
had been successful, and the ignominious end of the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>matter for the English was that Massachusetts finally had to
abandon her claims against him, and to make him a gift as
an acknowledgment of her own wrong in joining de la Tour's
expedition.<a id='r566'></a><a href='#f566' class='c014'><sup>[566]</sup></a> The affair, however, helped to strengthen the
deputies against the body of ministers and magistrates, whose
unwarranted action, as well as lack of statesmanship and even
of common prudence, had been mainly instrumental in bringing
unnecessary humiliation upon the colony without the
consent of its representatives.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor did the Bay and other colonies derive much greater
honor from their diplomacy with the Dutch, one of the main
results of which, indeed, was to develop such a conflict of
interests among themselves as threatened to break up the
Confederation. As we have already seen, it was an open
question whether England or Holland had the better title to
the central portion at least, of the territory claimed by the
latter. As to the title of the individual settlers, English and
Dutch, on the Connecticut and the Delaware, it would appear
that the Dutch, who were there by the authority of their home
government, were in a much better legal position than the
English, who were mere squatters in the wilderness, without
any patent or charter rights. The New Englanders, however,
outnumbered their neighbors twenty to one, and the land in
dispute was good. The advice of the British Ambassador
in the States General was, therefore, acted upon with the
consciousness of overwhelming force. “Crowd on,” he wrote,
“crowding the Dutch out of those places they have, but
without hostility or any act of violence.”<a id='r567'></a><a href='#f567' class='c014'><sup>[567]</sup></a> Steadily the
advancing flood of the English overwhelmed Dutch claims.
It poured westward on Long Island and along the Sound, up
the Connecticut,—encircling the little fort of Good Hope,—up
the Housatonic, and stopped only a few miles from New
Amsterdam itself. A trading company formed in New Haven,
but including capitalists from Massachusetts, tried also to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>plant on the Delaware in despite of both Dutch and Swedes.<a id='r568'></a><a href='#f568' class='c014'><sup>[568]</sup></a>
The situation was bound to result in constant causes for disputes,
grave or trifling. At the bottom of all was the desire
of the English for the land, and the sense of injury and inferior
numbers on the part of the Dutch. Governor Kieft touched
the point, when, in reply to a letter of complaint from the
United Colonies, concerning some alleged misdemeanors by
the garrison of the little Dutch post at Good Hope, he wrote
that “when we heare the inhabitants of Hartford complayninge
of us, we seem to heare Esops wolfe complayninge of the
lambe.”<a id='r569'></a><a href='#f569' class='c014'><sup>[569]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The several attempts to plant forcibly on the Delaware were
successfully repulsed by the two nations already in possession
there; and in 1646, Kieft sent a protest to the New Haven
magistrates against their settling on the Housatonic. To this
they replied that they could not imagine what river the Dutch
could mean, and unfairly offered to leave any dispute to the
English Parliament as arbitrators; while at the New Haven
court, “it was fully and satisfyeingly voted” that they would
make good their titles “at the trading house, and leave the
issue of things to God.”<a id='r570'></a><a href='#f570' class='c014'><sup>[570]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Contentions, new and old, dragged along, embittering relations,
and filling a very large portion of the United Colonies'
time and records. Finally, after Stuyvesant had been governor
for three years, he went to Hartford to try to arrange an
amicable settlement of all outstanding grievances between the
colonies of the two nations. The negotiations were carried on
in writing; and both then and in subsequent correspondence,
it must be confessed that, in dignity and courtesy, the Dutch
Governor shone by comparison with the English Commissioners.
His tone throughout was statesmanlike and dignified,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>while that of the Puritans was frequently low, and, at times,
insulting.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was finally decided that each side should appoint two
deputies to negotiate a treaty, and Stuyvesant nominated, as
his, two Englishmen, then resident in the Dutch colony.<a id='r571'></a><a href='#f571' class='c014'><sup>[571]</sup></a>
As a result of their deliberations, a treaty was signed, in September,
1650, which should have set the disputed matters
finally at rest.<a id='r572'></a><a href='#f572' class='c014'><sup>[572]</sup></a> Most of the smaller questions were passed
over, while that of the Delaware was referred to Europe.
The explanation of the Dutch Governor as to a ship seized at
New Haven, some years earlier, was accepted as final,<a id='r573'></a><a href='#f573' class='c014'><sup>[573]</sup></a> and a
definite boundary line agreed upon, which gave to the English
all territory, except Fort Good Hope, lying eastward of Oyster
Bay on Long Island and of a line beginning four miles west
of Greenwich on the mainland, and running north, provided
it came nowhere within ten miles of the Hudson. Greenwich,
also, was to remain to the Dutch, who were otherwise not to
build within six miles of the new boundary, which was to be
referred to England and Holland for ratification. Holland
subsequently accepted it,<a id='r574'></a><a href='#f574' class='c014'><sup>[574]</sup></a> but England never acted, as to have
done so would have been to recognize Dutch claims as valid,
which she persistently refused to do.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor, from their later correspondence, can we conclude that
all the English colonies themselves intended to accept the
settlement as final, or that they really desired a friendly end
to the controversies. Within a year after the signing of the
treaty, New Haven attempted further encroachments upon
the Delaware, and, when stopped by Stuyvesant, complained
to the United Colonies, whose Commissioners wrote a bullying
letter to the Dutch Governor.<a id='r575'></a><a href='#f575' class='c014'><sup>[575]</sup></a> The following year, in Europe,
Cromwell forced war upon Holland, and New Haven and
Connecticut felt that their chance had come to make an end
of their neighbor, whose chief offense seems to have been the
prior possession of lands the English coveted. They claimed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>indeed, to have information that Stuyvesant was stirring up
the Indians to attack them, and were, or pretended to be, in
mortal terror; but there is no substantial evidence that any
such plot existed, and when questioned about it, the sachems
Mixim, Pesacus, and Ninigret denied it in the most positive
terms.<a id='r576'></a><a href='#f576' class='c014'><sup>[576]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Three commissioners, whom the United Colonies sent to New
Amsterdam to investigate the rumor, were met with fairness
by Stuyvesant, who placed no obstacle in their way for taking
any testimony they wished, asking only, which was reasonable
enough, that the inquiries should be conducted jointly. This
the English refused, but set down all the gossip they could
gather, treated the Governor with great rudeness, and then
left, refusing at the last moment to wait even a few hours to
receive an answer Stuyvesant had prepared.<a id='r577'></a><a href='#f577' class='c014'><sup>[577]</sup></a> The fact may
well have been that, in view of the overwhelming odds against
them, the Dutch were counting upon using the Indians as
auxiliaries in case they should have been attacked; but there
was nothing to indicate, what would have been exceedingly
unlikely, that they had been planning to assume the offensive,
even by savage proxy.</p>

<p class='c001'>War, however, was ardently desired by both Connecticut and
New Haven, and Rhode Island, somewhat liberally interpreting
orders from England, started privateering on her own account
against Dutch ships.<a id='r578'></a><a href='#f578' class='c014'><sup>[578]</sup></a> Connecticut, on the strength of
similar orders, hastily sequestrated the Dutch fort at Good
Hope, which she never again relinquished.<a id='r579'></a><a href='#f579' class='c014'><sup>[579]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Massachusetts, however, had no interest in the quarrel.
The lands she coveted did not lie in that direction, and she
professed to be unable to go to war save in a just cause.<a id='r580'></a><a href='#f580' class='c014'><sup>[580]</sup></a> Her
moral stand might be considered more sincere, were it not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>for the quite contrary position she consistently assumed when
her own interests were at stake. Her refusal, however, undoubtedly
prevented an act of great injustice, although
her action permanently weakened the Confederacy; for she
claimed, in spite of the obvious intention of the Articles, that
the Commissioners had no power to declare an offensive, but
only a defensive, war. This unwarranted construction was
bitterly opposed by the other three members, who properly
claimed that, if any of the colonies had the right, on occasion,
to alter the Articles to suit herself, then the league must necessarily
“breake and bee dissolved.” “Whether this violation
proceed from some unwarrantable Scruple of Conscience or
from some other engagement of sperit,” they wrote, “the Massachusetts
neither expresse, nor will the Commissioners determine.”<a id='r581'></a><a href='#f581' class='c014'><sup>[581]</sup></a>
In the wilderness, men come to know one another
well; and her neighbors' faith in the Bay Colony's purity of
motive had been too often sorely tried to permit them, perhaps,
to do her entire justice. War was declared in September, seven
of the eight Commissioners voting in favor of it, although
Massachusetts refused to be bound.<a id='r582'></a><a href='#f582' class='c014'><sup>[582]</sup></a> Her interpretation of
the Articles having been vehemently denied by the western
colonies, she turned to Plymouth, but failed to overawe her
little neighbor, who bluntly answered that the Articles “are
so full and plaine that they occation not any such queries.”<a id='r583'></a><a href='#f583' class='c014'><sup>[583]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Peace having been declared in Europe, however, the war
was not prosecuted, and in the following year Massachusetts
completely reversed her position, and agreed to be bound by
the Articles of Union in their “literall sence and true meaning.”<a id='r584'></a><a href='#f584' class='c014'><sup>[584]</sup></a>
The real motive for her refusal to attack the Dutch
may, perhaps, be found in that fear, on the part of the East,
of any rapid extension of the western frontier, which we have
already noted. Had the western colonies acquired the Hudson
River and the sources of the rich fur-trade possessed by
the Dutch, the supremacy of Massachusetts might readily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>have been lost to the younger colonies, which, on the other
hand, could be counted upon to remain subordinate to herself
in power and numbers if westward expansion were denied
them. So long as the balance remained undisturbed, or was
altered only in her favor, she could count upon the Confederacy
to aid her own plans, nullifying any decision adverse to
her interests by her greater strength, as she had just done.
Having gained her point, it was, therefore, to her advantage
to restore the fullest authority to the league; and the suggestion
by her three colleagues, quoted above, that her action
might have been dictated by “some other engagement of
sperit” than conscientious scruples, would indicate that they
perfectly recognized the situation.</p>

<p class='c001'>During the decade and a half that we are now considering,
there was continual uneasiness among the savages, but no
serious outbreak. Their relations with the whites, however,
were the subject of constant negotiations, which, with the
entries concerning the Dutch, absorb almost the whole of the
records of the Confederacy. The most striking incident was
one which, unfortunately, redounded but little to the credit of
the colonists.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1643, a quarrel broke out between Uncas and a sachem
named Sequasson, and after the English had ineffectually attempted
to preserve peace between them, Uncas attacked
Sequasson, killing seven or eight of his men, and securing considerable
booty.<a id='r585'></a><a href='#f585' class='c014'><sup>[585]</sup></a> The defeated sachem was an ally of the
Narragansett chief Miantanomo, who requested permission
from the English for liberty to revenge himself upon the Mohegan.
This was granted, and Miantanomo, followed by a
thousand warriors, fell upon Uncas, who was supported by
less than one half that number.<a id='r586'></a><a href='#f586' class='c014'><sup>[586]</sup></a> The Mohegans, nevertheless
were successful, and Miantanomo was taken prisoner,
through treachery. It will be recalled that Samuel Gorton
had bought his lands through the Narragansett chief from two
of his sachems, who had subsequently repudiated the transaction,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>and placed themselves under the jurisdiction of Massachusetts.
It will be remembered also that Miantanomo, in
spite of recent suspicions, had consistently been a friend of the
English, that he had sheltered Williams, when banished from
Massachusetts, and that, through the influence of the latter,
the Narragansetts had sided with the colonists in the Pequot
war. Gorton now unwisely tried to save the savage's life by
writing a letter to Uncas, threatening him should he harm his
prisoner.<a id='r587'></a><a href='#f587' class='c014'><sup>[587]</sup></a> Uncas, upon its receipt, hurried the captive to
Hartford, to advise with the authorities as to what course he
should take. At Miantanomo's own request, he was placed
in custody of the English.</p>

<p class='c001'>There had been rumors of a general rising of the natives in
the preceding year, and the Commissioners of the United
Colonies, meeting at Boston, after serious consideration decided
that it would not be safe to set the unexpected captive
free; but they had no grounds upon which to kill him. As
usual, they turned to the church for advice, and, as usual, that
advice was for blood, “the most judicious elders,” who had
been consulted, unanimously agreeing “that he ought to be
put to death.” Of the four reasons for their decision as given
by Winthrop, not one justified the sentence. One of them,
that he was “of a turbulent and proud spirit,” was hardly a
capital offense even in Massachusetts, nor could the beating
of one of his own subjects be thus construed. His alleged
heading of an Indian conspiracy had not been proved, and if
the authorities had really believed it, it is not likely that they
would have granted him formal permission to take the warpath
with a thousand warriors against another of their own
allies. Opposed to the charges were to be set the facts that,
in the past, he had performed inestimable service as a friend
of the English, and that he was now in their hands at his own
suggestion, trusting in the white man's justice. He had not,
however, reckoned on the church, and it is impossible not to
agree with the often expressed surmise that the leaders of
that institution condemned him, not as the enemy of the English,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>but as the friend of the heretic Gorton and the tolerant
Williams.<a id='r588'></a><a href='#f588' class='c014'><sup>[588]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>There had been no pretense of trial, and neither the accused
nor any witnesses had been summoned. Nor did the English
execute the sentence, which duty they entrusted to Uncas,
who was promised protection against the Narragansetts if he
would perform it.<a id='r589'></a><a href='#f589' class='c014'><sup>[589]</sup></a> Uncas readily undertook the work, and
Miantanomo, probably cursing his folly for having ever trusted
a white man, was put to death. “That the Indians might
know that the English did approve of it, they sent 12 or 14
musketeers home with Uncas to abide a time with him for his
defence, if need should be”; which shows how little real credence
was placed in the story of a general rising.<a id='r590'></a><a href='#f590' class='c014'><sup>[590]</sup></a> The savages
could have made no complaint, had the English from the beginning
preserved a strict neutrality; but they had not done so.
They had given Miantanomo leave to take the war-path, and,
when he was captured, they had assumed the responsibility
of seeing that justice should be done. They had, nevertheless,
observed none of its forms, and had merely handed the prisoner
back to his savage captor with what amounted to orders for
his death, without trial and without a hearing. Aside from
the injustice of the course pursued, it is difficult to think of
one more certain to turn the “proud and turbulent” spirits of
the slain man's thousand followers permanently against the
English settlers.<a id='r591'></a><a href='#f591' class='c014'><sup>[591]</sup></a> Nevertheless, for the present, in spite of a
threatened outbreak upon their part two years after the slaying
of their chief, the Indian relations of the colonists for long
consisted mainly in efforts to preserve the peace among rival
native tribes and to collect tribute.<a id='r592'></a><a href='#f592' class='c014'><sup>[592]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The disputes of the colonies, however, were by no means
limited to those with foreigners and savages. The union,
which had been so seriously threatened by the Dutch war, had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>earlier suffered another severe strain in a controversy between
Connecticut and Massachusetts over questions of taxation.
When the fort at Saybrook was bought from Fenwick by the
former colony, for the purpose of protecting and controlling
the mouth of the river, the contract provided that he should
receive, in part payment, certain tolls to be levied upon merchandise
exported by all the River Towns.<a id='r593'></a><a href='#f593' class='c014'><sup>[593]</sup></a> A few months
later, the General Court passed a law regulating the amounts
of these duties and providing for their collection.<a id='r594'></a><a href='#f594' class='c014'><sup>[594]</sup></a> The
boundary line between Connecticut and Massachusetts was
still undetermined; but as the latter colony claimed Springfield,
which was under its jurisdiction, that town objected to
being taxed by Connecticut, and refused to pay the duties demanded.<a id='r595'></a><a href='#f595' class='c014'><sup>[595]</sup></a>
The question was referred to the Commissioners of
the United Colonies by Connecticut in 1647, though the fort
had then been destroyed by fire. The objections of Massachusetts,
presented in writing, were not well taken, and one
was an absolutely false statement, Connecticut having no
difficulty in showing that the Bay Colony's contention that
the question of a river-toll had delayed the formation of the
Confederacy by ten years was palpably absurd and impossible.<a id='r596'></a><a href='#f596' class='c014'><sup>[596]</sup></a>
Another contention, that the toll was not levied upon the
Dutch at Good Hope, was also of no import, for the commerce
of that tiny post was slight, and by taxing it, international
questions would have been raised, to no advantage. Moreover,
as the main value of the fort at Saybrook was to protect
the river from the Dutch, its upkeep could hardly be considered
as a charge of which that nation shared the advantages.
The duties required were not discriminatory, and Connecticut
was merely asking that the other permanent settlers up the
river should share the same burden which she imposed upon
herself.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although the justice of her claim was upheld by the Commissioners
of New Haven and Plymouth, Massachusetts refused
to accept the decision as binding, and threatened retaliation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>which, in 1649, took the form of an import duty on all
goods from the three colonies entering at Boston Harbor,
which was then the main channel through which all business
was conducted with Europe.<a id='r597'></a><a href='#f597' class='c014'><sup>[597]</sup></a> The wording of the act made
it obvious that it was to punish the three smaller colonies for
not having agreed with herself; and the Confederacy's delegates
resolved that “how fare the premisses agree with the lawe
of love and with the tenure and import of the articles of Confederation,
the Commissioners tender and recomend to the
serius Concideration of the Generall Court of the Massachusits.”
Wearied with her continuous rejection of their valid
rulings for five years, they also added that they “desire to bee
spared in all further agitations Concerning sprinkfield.”<a id='r598'></a><a href='#f598' class='c014'><sup>[598]</sup></a> Apparently,
however, the pertinacity of Massachusetts won the
struggle, to which bitterness was added by her persistent refusal,
for seventy years, to acknowledge the real location of
her southern boundary line, which she had extended slightly
into Connecticut territory.<a id='r599'></a><a href='#f599' class='c014'><sup>[599]</sup></a> That “line” she had had surveyed,
in 1642, by the somewhat odd method of having two
“skillful artists,” as she called them, locate a point three miles
south of the Charles River, and then, in order to avoid the
long walk across country, sail around by the Sound, and ascend
the Connecticut River to a point which they agreed was
in the same latitude as that from which they had started. A
map, a pen, and a ruler completed this arduous bit of surveying
work in the wilderness.<a id='r600'></a><a href='#f600' class='c014'><sup>[600]</sup></a> Unfortunately, it did not satisfy
Connecticut.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was always a certain latitude, not astronomical, in
the Bay Colony's treatment of boundaries, however; and, in
spite of the reasonably strict definition of her own by her charter,
the colony slowly expanded, like a balloon filling with gas.
We have already seen how she had annexed New Hampshire,
and, by her new interpretation of the charter, laid claim to
Maine. The state of affairs in England, during the Civil War
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>and Commonwealth, offered her the opportunity to make that
claim a reality; and by 1658, the entire province had been
annexed, bit by bit. In the midst of the civil commotions
in the home country, the royalist Gorges had died, and his
heirs had had no chance to answer their colonists' letters
or to look after their affairs in America. Godfrey was elected
governor of the settlements about York, the inhabitants there,
“with one free and universanimous consent,” binding themselves
into a body politic,<a id='r601'></a><a href='#f601' class='c014'><sup>[601]</sup></a> while farther east, the feud between
Cleeve and Winter, the latter representing Trelawney's
interests, had been continued. Trelawney, a royalist like
Gorges, was imprisoned in England by the Parliament, and
soon after died. Cleeve went to England, procured the assistance
of Alexander Rigby, who had bought the questionable
Lygonia patent, and secured from him a confirmation and
extension of his own holdings. This was three years before
the election of Godfrey at York in 1649, and Josselyn, who was
then representing the Gorges interests, disputed Cleeve's
claims, and both parties agreed to arbitration by Massachusetts.
The jury failed to find a verdict, and the dispute
continued.<a id='r602'></a><a href='#f602' class='c014'><sup>[602]</sup></a> The following year, the Commissioners of Plantations
confirmed Rigby's patent, even enlarging its interpretation,
and so confined the Gorges territory to that south of
Saco.<a id='r603'></a><a href='#f603' class='c014'><sup>[603]</sup></a> Cleeve established a government within the now legal,
if not equitable, Lygonia grant, and the quarrel between him
and Godfrey seems to have been settled. Affairs promised
to assume a more ordered aspect, and in 1651 Godfrey sent a
petition to Parliament, asking that the inhabitants of Maine
be declared “Members of the Common Wealth of England,”
and confirmed in their rights.<a id='r604'></a><a href='#f604' class='c014'><sup>[604]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Massachusetts saw her opportunity slipping, and decided
to act. In May of the following year, the General Court
voted that the northern boundary of the colony was a line
running from sea to sea and passing through a point three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>miles north of the most northerly section of the Merrimack,
sending out more “skilfull artists” to find the exact latitude.<a id='r605'></a><a href='#f605' class='c014'><sup>[605]</sup></a>
Godfrey vigorously objected, recalling to Massachusetts the
services he had rendered her in England when her charter had
been questioned, and denying the validity of her new claim.<a id='r606'></a><a href='#f606' class='c014'><sup>[606]</sup></a>
His protest, of course, was of no avail, and in May, 1653,
Massachusetts sent a commission, headed by Bradstreet,
forcibly to require the submission of the inhabitants at Kittery.
After much debate among the settlers, they agreed to submit,
provided their conditions were accepted. This, however, was
“wholy denied by the comissioners, who told them they must
first submitt to the government, and then they should be
ready to affoord such liberties and imunities as they should
think meete to graunt.”<a id='r607'></a><a href='#f607' class='c014'><sup>[607]</sup></a> To this demand, as illegal as it
was arrogant, the settlers were forced to yield an unconditional
assent; and Godfrey returned to England, to add another, in
the day of reckoning, to the enemies of Massachusetts. The
country was organized as the County of York, and the towns
incorporated with the same privileges as Dover.<a id='r608'></a><a href='#f608' class='c014'><sup>[608]</sup></a> Later in
the same year, the commission continued its journey, and
Wells, Cape Porpus, and Saco were likewise forced to submit.<a id='r609'></a><a href='#f609' class='c014'><sup>[609]</sup></a>
Five years later, in spite of repeated protests from Cleeve,
the whole of Maine and Lygonia were absorbed as far as
Casco Bay, and the process of annexation was complete.<a id='r610'></a><a href='#f610' class='c014'><sup>[610]</sup></a> Of
the principalities that Mason and Gorges had spent their
fortunes to acquire, not a foot was left to their heirs.</p>

<p class='c001'>By her policy of annexation, Massachusetts had added over
forty thousand square miles to her territory; while by that
of nullification, she had patently shown that the bonds uniting
the New England Confederacy were but ropes of sand. Confederation
was a failure and imperial control as yet impossible.
The unification of New England was progressing rapidly, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>it was a mere process of absorption by Massachusetts. Had
there been no hindrance offered by England to the movement,
the fate of the other colonies was amply foreshadowed. A
single state, with its capital at Boston, guided by the reactionary
ideas of its leaders, would probably have arisen, and
much of the work already accomplished for the enfranchisement
of the individual by Connecticut and Rhode Island, as well as
the progress so far made by Massachusetts herself, might have
been lost.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although her policy had met with so little real resistance
in the north, it received an unexpected check in the south,
from the despised Rhode Islanders, while the restoration of the
monarchy in England was permanently to save the independence
of that colony and of Connecticut. In view of the circumstances,
that event, and the assertion of imperial control
which followed it, cannot be considered as so inimical to the
interests of liberty and the colonies as writers whose attention
and sympathy have been wholly devoted to Massachusetts
have usually pictured it. In spite of the many fine qualities
of the Bay Colony, and the services which she rendered in the
settlement of New England, it was fortunate that her career
of aggrandizement was halted, for the United States could ill
afford to have lost the independent contributions made to her
intellectual and political life by the smaller colonies. Indeed,
it may even be questioned, if a single powerful, unscrupulous,
and aggressive state had come to occupy the whole of New
England, and possibly the Hudson Valley, whether the United
States, as a federal nation in its present form, would have
come into existence at all. When one considers the possibilities
involved in a wholly different balance of power among
the colonies in the following century, the early career of Massachusetts
and the checks it encountered take on a larger
interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>The four settlements about Narragansett Bay, whose extreme
individualism and disinclination to submit to any
superior government have already been noted, would probably
have been exceedingly slow to form a combination, had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>it not been for the danger to their existence, threatened by
their neighbors. Massachusetts had already set up claims
to a portion of the territory, and assumed jurisdiction over
some of the natives at the time of the Gorton affair in 1643;
and contemplated more aggressive action by attempting to
secure a charter from the Commissioners of Plantations, in
the same year. While never legally granted, this pretended
patent was at first used by the colony to bolster its claims.<a id='r611'></a><a href='#f611' class='c014'><sup>[611]</sup></a>
At the same time at which Massachusetts was trying to obtain
that document, Williams, then in England for the purpose,
was also endeavoring to secure a patent which would enable
the settlements legally to resist encroachment. In this he was
successful, and, after that, “the country about us was more
friendly,” he wrote, “and treated us as an authorized colony,
only the difference of our consciences much obstructed.”<a id='r612'></a><a href='#f612' class='c014'><sup>[612]</sup></a>
The charter named the towns of Providence, Newport, and
Portsmouth, and incorporated a vague territory bounded in
part by Plymouth, Massachusetts, and the Pequot River, as
“the Providence Plantations in the Narragansett Bay in New
England.”<a id='r613'></a><a href='#f613' class='c014'><sup>[613]</sup></a> The settlers were given the right to erect any
form of government which they might choose.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Narragansett Indians, after the death of Miantanomo,
had agreed to place themselves directly under the protection
of the English crown; and Gorton, who, after his release from
Massachusetts, had gone back to Warwick, was chosen by
them to go to England and carry their submission to the King.<a id='r614'></a><a href='#f614' class='c014'><sup>[614]</sup></a>
In 1644, Plymouth had renewed her claim to Warwick; but in
the following year, twenty families from Braintree having petitioned
the Massachusetts General Court for permission to
settle on Gorton's lands, the Court had granted them ten
thousand acres there, and arranged for the organization of a
town.<a id='r615'></a><a href='#f615' class='c014'><sup>[615]</sup></a> A Plymouth settler objected, however, when the party
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>arrived, and the new planters dispersed to other places. At
the same meeting of the court at which the Braintree men were
granted their land, a letter was ordered sent to Williams, stating
that Massachusetts had received a charter for Narragansett
Bay, and ordering him to desist from exercising any authority.<a id='r616'></a><a href='#f616' class='c014'><sup>[616]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Nothing had been done by the Narragansett towns to combine
under their patent, until May, 1647, when a meeting
attended by freemen from all four, was held at Portsmouth,
at which it was voted to give Warwick the same privileges as
Providence.<a id='r617'></a><a href='#f617' class='c014'><sup>[617]</sup></a> The new government derived directly from the
people, and not from the towns, those present also agreeing
that it should be “democraticall, that is to say, a Government
held by the free and voluntarie consent of all, or the greater
parte of the free Inhabitants.”<a id='r618'></a><a href='#f618' class='c014'><sup>[618]</sup></a> Legislation was, in the
main, to be initiated by the people in town meeting, and not
by the Assembly, which latter was to be a representative body,
consisting of six delegates from each township. Such bills as
might be initiated in the Assembly, or General Court, were
required to be submitted to the four towns at their meetings,
the whole legislative system thus being “a crude combination
of initiative and referendum.”<a id='r619'></a><a href='#f619' class='c014'><sup>[619]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Meanwhile, Gorton had obtained a letter from the Commissioners
for Plantations, granting him safe conduct through
Massachusetts, and allowing him to resettle upon his lands
without molestation, until the disputed title should be decided.<a id='r620'></a><a href='#f620' class='c014'><sup>[620]</sup></a>
To this, Massachusetts returned an answer defending
her actions in the case and her refusal to allow of appeals to
England; but Gorton was permitted to pass through her territory
on his way to Warwick.<a id='r621'></a><a href='#f621' class='c014'><sup>[621]</sup></a> The settlers there, however,
were much troubled by the Indians, whom Massachusetts
claimed as under her jurisdiction; and after receiving two
complaints from the Warwick people, the Commissioners of
the United Colonies finally returned answer that they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>ready to undertake the settlement of the question as to “under
what Colonie youer Plantation doth fall.”<a id='r622'></a><a href='#f622' class='c014'><sup>[622]</sup></a> The following
year, 1650, Massachusetts, by agreement with Plymouth, acquired
all rights which that colony might possess about Warwick,
but the Commissioners of the United Colonies refused to
sanction the transfer.<a id='r623'></a><a href='#f623' class='c014'><sup>[623]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>As before, however, there was a party at Patuxet working
in the interests of the Bay Colony, and in 1651, certain settlers
there appealed to her for protection against taxes levied upon
them. Massachusetts, still claiming jurisdiction, wrote to
Williams, requiring that the government refrain from taxing
the residents of Warwick, and stating that in case it refused
to comply, Massachusetts would seek satisfaction “in such
manner as God shall put into theire hands.”<a id='r624'></a><a href='#f624' class='c014'><sup>[624]</sup></a> There was no
doubt what this meant.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was, moreover, additional trouble in store for the distracted
settlements. William Coddington, one of the original
settlers at Aquidneck, had treacherously gone to England,
and there procured a commission appointing him Governor
of Rhode Island, his territory thus including the two towns
of Portsmouth and Newport.<a id='r625'></a><a href='#f625' class='c014'><sup>[625]</sup></a> This would have disrupted
the union, and have left the mainland towns a prey to Massachusetts.
The four towns, being now at last closely united
in aim by the common danger, sent Williams and Clarke to
England, to protest against Coddington's action; and, largely
through the influence of Williams's friendship with Vane,
they were entirely successful. Coddington's commission was
withdrawn; Williams obtained a safe conduct through Massachusetts,
and brought a letter from Vane urging the colonists
to unite peaceably and to avoid tumult and disorder.<a id='r626'></a><a href='#f626' class='c014'><sup>[626]</sup></a> In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>1654, the towns reunited by formal action, and two years
later, Coddington submitted to the authorities.<a id='r627'></a><a href='#f627' class='c014'><sup>[627]</sup></a> In 1658,
Massachusetts at last resigned her pretensions,<a id='r628'></a><a href='#f628' class='c014'><sup>[628]</sup></a> while, to guard
against any such troubles in future as had been brought about
by that colony's faction in Patuxet, Rhode Island passed a
law, somewhat later, that, if any citizen should attempt to
place his lands under the jurisdiction of another colony, they
should be forfeited.<a id='r629'></a><a href='#f629' class='c014'><sup>[629]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The government, however, was by no means through with
Massachusetts, nor with its other neighbor, Connecticut, both
of whom were soon to lay claim to the soil in another direction.
The Pawcatuck River, which is the present western
boundary of the state, had also been the dividing line between
the Narragansetts on the east and the Pequots on the west;
and after the destruction of the latter, both Connecticut and
Massachusetts had claimed the Pequot country by right of
conquest. In spite of attempts to divide the spoil between
them, the dispute dragged along, with clashings of interests
and of jurisdiction.<a id='r630'></a><a href='#f630' class='c014'><sup>[630]</sup></a> Massachusetts, however, not content
with claiming a large part of the country west of the Pawcatuck
as a reward for her share in the war, was also constantly
endeavoring to establish her claims to the rich tract lying
between the east bank of that river and Narragansett Bay,
known as the Narragansett country. In spite of her defeat
in the Gorton episode, she continued her efforts, and in 1659,
a year after Southertown, the present Stonington, had been
declared by the Massachusetts Court to be a part of Suffolk
County in that colony,<a id='r631'></a><a href='#f631' class='c014'><sup>[631]</sup></a> the Atherton Company was formed,
mainly by Massachusetts land-speculators, to secure title
to the Narragansett lands.<a id='r632'></a><a href='#f632' class='c014'><sup>[632]</sup></a> A grant was obtained by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>company from one of the sachems, and, in the following year,
four others, in order to meet a fine which had been imposed
upon them by the United Colonies, executed a mortgage deed
of the entire Narragansett country to the Atherton Company,
except such parts as might have already been granted, the
Indians having six months in which to redeem the pledged
lands, which, of course, they failed to do.<a id='r633'></a><a href='#f633' class='c014'><sup>[633]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Massachusetts herself had no valid claim to any of the
territory, to which, on the other hand, Rhode Island was
justly entitled under her charter, which had named the “Pequot
River and Country” as the western boundary.<a id='r634'></a><a href='#f634' class='c014'><sup>[634]</sup></a> In October,
1661, a clash occurred between Rhode Island citizens
claiming lands at Stonington and the Massachusetts authorities,
three Rhode Islanders being carried off to Boston,
and imprisoned.<a id='r635'></a><a href='#f635' class='c014'><sup>[635]</sup></a> The Rhode Island government protested,
and denied the pretensions of Massachusetts to the disputed
territories, and herself claimed jurisdiction over the lands
owned by the Atherton Company. Massachusetts, some
months later, renewed the old fiction of her Narragansett
patent, and asserted, what she must have known to be false,
that under it she had a valid title to “all that tract of land,
from Pequot River to Plymouth line,” and ordered the Rhode
Island authorities to desist from exercising any government
within their limits.<a id='r636'></a><a href='#f636' class='c014'><sup>[636]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The troubles between Rhode Island and Massachusetts,
between Massachusetts and Connecticut, and between Connecticut
and Rhode Island, were thus rapidly approaching
the point at which a general intercolonial war might easily
have resulted in the annihilation of the smallest colony, and
a possible quarrel over the spoils by the two victors, already
bitterly quarreling over the spoils of a war of twenty years
earlier. The disgraceful spectacle of two colonies, planted
in the wilderness ostensibly for the glory of God, and still
pretending to be guided by his laws, annihilating a weaker
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>neighbor in order to annex her harbors and rich lands, was
fortunately prevented by the reassertion of imperial control
by England.</p>

<p class='c001'>Meanwhile, the little Rhode Island commonwealth had
established its internal affairs upon a firm and orderly basis,
and in spite of the dire forebodings, and every possible impediment
thrown in his way by Massachusetts, Williams had
finally succeeded in his effort to prove that civil and religious
liberty was not incompatible with a well-ordered state.
Against all her enemies, without and within, the colony had
won her way to intellectual freedom, and had advanced along
the path in which it has been the glory of the nation to follow,
while the restoration of the monarchy in England intervened
to save her from further molestation from her powerful Puritan
neighbors, and enabled her to pursue her chosen ways in peace.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XI <br> <br> THE DEFEAT OF THE THEOCRACY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The same decade and a half, the political events of which
we traced in the last chapter, was to witness also religious
movements of utmost importance. The firm establishment
of the government of Rhode Island, based upon religious
liberty, and the preservation of the independence of that
colony and of its democratic neighbor, Connecticut, were
matters of profound import in the political and intellectual
life of America. Not less so was the struggle between the
leaders of the theocracy and the growing liberalism of the
people of Massachusetts. As usual, the political and religious
movements were inextricably intertwined, and the same conditions
that brought forth the political disturbance over the
petition of Dr. Child and his associates, in 1645, were responsible
for the most important step taken in the ecclesiastical
organization of the theocracy some months later.</p>

<p class='c001'>That petition had called attention to undoubted evils and
injustices in the political and religious régime in Massachusetts;
and however effectually the government might silence
the protesting leaders, the underlying causes were so widespread
as to necessitate some action in regard to them. Owing
to the church-membership test for the franchise, the unenfranchised
class was so large, and the disadvantage under
which it labored was so palpably unjust, that the demand for
reform was growing steadily louder. Not only had there been
from the very beginning a considerable element in the population
which, under no circumstances, cared to join the New
England churches, but there was also a large one which would
have been glad to do so, had the process not been made so
difficult for them. It was not enough that a person should
believe in the doctrines of the Church, that he should desire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>to live a godly life and be in communion with it, but he
was also required to have experienced some special motion of
God in his heart, by which he had been convicted of his sin,
and become regenerate. Of that conversion, he was further
obliged to make a public declaration before the congregation,
describing the particular manner in which he had thus felt the
workings of the spirit within him. Many blameless Christian
men and women did not feel that they could discover any such
extraordinary change in their lives as their rulers demanded;
and modesty and a natural reticence prevented many more
from attempting the trying ordeal of publicly detailing such
an intimate spiritual experience.<a id='r637'></a><a href='#f637' class='c014'><sup>[637]</sup></a> Failing that, however, they
were debarred from Christian communion and from all voice
in the civil government, and their children were also denied
baptism and participation in the life of the Church. As in
Massachusetts no churches were allowed except such as partook
of the “New England way,” it followed that those who
could not join them were politically disfranchised, and that
they and their children were cut off from the advantages of
Christian fellowship and discipline.</p>

<p class='c001'>In so far as the resultant political disabilities were concerned,
there were two ways in which the situation might have been
remedied. The first and, according to modern ideas, the
natural one would have been to do away with the religious
qualification for the franchise. This was, theoretically at
least, the method of Plymouth and Connecticut and Rhode
Island, and of the Bay Colony in so far as its possessions in
Maine were concerned. Nevertheless, it did not commend itself
to the Massachusetts leaders, and for that reason, and
also to meet the religious features of the case, a second method
was favored by many, of making less rigid the requirements
for admission to the church. Of the two methods, the latter
would, of course, be more acceptable to the clergy, not as a
step forward, but as the lesser of two evils. They were, in
fact, at that very time planning a more formal organization of
all the churches, and the establishment of a uniform practice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>among them.<a id='r638'></a><a href='#f638' class='c014'><sup>[638]</sup></a> The creation of such a standard can hardly
be considered as consistent with the principles in which Congregationalism
had originated; but the Church in Massachusetts
had become as completely a state church as the Anglican had
ever been in England.<a id='r639'></a><a href='#f639' class='c014'><sup>[639]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In 1646, soon after the presentation of the Child petition,
some of the Elders presented a bill to the General Court, asking
that body to call a synod at the end of the summer, to
consider these various problems. The bill was promptly passed
by the magistrates; but the deputies demurred, denying that
the civil authorities had power over the ecclesiastical. It was
conceded, however, that the call might go out as a request and
not as a command.<a id='r640'></a><a href='#f640' class='c014'><sup>[640]</sup></a> According to the notice, the synod was
to agree “upon one forme of government and discipline,” and
to consider whether “more liberty and latitude” might be
yielded in the matters of church membership and baptism.<a id='r641'></a><a href='#f641' class='c014'><sup>[641]</sup></a>
When their labors should be finished, the result was to be submitted
to the General Court, to receive “such approbation as
is meete.”<a id='r642'></a><a href='#f642' class='c014'><sup>[642]</sup></a> When the synod met, the churches of Boston and
Salem refused to join, partly because they believed that it was
intended to bind the liberty of churches by the passage of
ecclesiastical laws by the General Court, “whereby men should
be forced under penalty to submit to them.” In view of a
point to be discussed later in the chapter, Winthrop's account
of the origin of the objections is interesting. The principal
men who raised them, he wrote, were some “who came
lately from England, where such a vast liberty was allowed,
and sought for by all that went under the name of Independents,
not only the anabaptists, antinomians, familists, seekers,
etc., but even the most godly and orthodox, as Mr. Goodwin,
Mr. Nye, Mr. Burrows, etc., who in the assembly there had
stood in opposition to the presbytery, and also the greater
part of the house of commons, who by their commissioners
had sent order to all English plantations in the West Indies
and Summers Islands, that all men should enjoy their liberty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>of conscience, and had by letters intimated the same to us.”<a id='r643'></a><a href='#f643' class='c014'><sup>[643]</sup></a>
Some weeks were consumed in endeavors to change the opinions
of the two churches, and when, after much difficulty, that
was finally accomplished, there was little time left for the work
of the synod, which adjourned in September, to meet the following
June. It was not until midsummer, 1648, however,
that, after another adjournment, it finally completed its labors.</p>

<p class='c001'>During the two years which it had been in session, Cromwell
and the Independents in England had removed all fear for
Massachusetts of Presbyterian or other interference from that
country, and the temporary alarm of the leaders had subsided.
The question of a more liberal policy, therefore, fell into the
background, and the synod occupied itself with the formulation
of a strict polity by which innovation might be resisted. Agreement
with the recent declaration of Parliament in matters of
doctrine was voted by adopting, with certain reservations, the
Westminster Confession of Faith; but the suggested religious
toleration was, of course, denied.<a id='r644'></a><a href='#f644' class='c014'><sup>[644]</sup></a> Quite on the contrary, in
fact, the Cambridge Platform, as the order of discipline adopted
has always been called, provided that the full power of the state
should be used to enforce obedience and conformity to the
rule and decisions of the priesthood. “Idolatry, Blasphemy,
Heresy, Venting corrupt and pernicious opinions,” the Platform
read, “are to be restrayned and punished by civil authority.
If any church one or more shall grow schismaticall, rending
it self from the communion of other churches, or shall walke
incorrigibly or obstinately in any corrupt way of their own, contrary
to the rule of the word; in such case, the Magistrate is
to put forth his coercive power, as the matter shall require.”<a id='r645'></a><a href='#f645' class='c014'><sup>[645]</sup></a>
What these early American persecutors, drunk with their own
conceit, were to think the “matter shall require,” when other
men refused to accept their personal interpretation of the mind
and ways of Almighty God as infallible, will be only too clearly
shown in the course of this chapter.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>When the Platform was presented for ratification by the
General Court, through the towns, it seems to have met with
considerable opposition on the part of the deputies. The magistrates,
owing to their customary close working agreement with
the ministers, approved of it unanimously; but the deputies,
representing public opinion rather than the oligarchy, repeated
their opposition of several years earlier. When, in 1645, new
laws had been proposed for the punishment of heretics, a brief
entry in the records tells of the struggle at that time. “The
Howse of Deputies,” so it reads, “cannot concur with our
honored magistrates in their bill to punish excommunicate
persons.”<a id='r646'></a><a href='#f646' class='c014'><sup>[646]</sup></a> They were defeated, however, and the next year
a long act was passed for the purpose.<a id='r647'></a><a href='#f647' class='c014'><sup>[647]</sup></a> Although the Cambridge
Platform had been adopted by the synod in 1648, and
had been considered several times by the General Court, the
deputies of many of the towns, even three years later, still
professed themselves unable to “see light to impose any forms
as necessary to be observed by the churches as a bindinge rule.”<a id='r648'></a><a href='#f648' class='c014'><sup>[648]</sup></a>
When it was finally passed by the Court, in October, 1651,
fourteen of the deputies still refused to concur, and their names,
an honored roll, are inscribed in the margin of the records.<a id='r649'></a><a href='#f649' class='c014'><sup>[649]</sup></a>
The towns they represented were Boston, Salem, Braintree,
Watertown, Roxbury, Wenham, Reading, Sudbury, Weymouth,
and Hingham, in Massachusetts, and Hampton in
New Hampshire.<a id='r650'></a><a href='#f650' class='c014'><sup>[650]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Platform represented no mere abstract doctrine. The
whole history of the oligarchy, thus far, indicated that the
clauses regarding heresy and schism were not intended to
remain dead letters. The new relations of the churches to
one another, and the strengthened combination of the civil
and ecclesiastical authorities, mark the high point attained by
the theocracy in its organized opposition to liberty of thought.
It had been growing steadily narrower and more intolerant,
more insistent upon the extirpation of every idea, religious or
political, that disturbed its own control over the minds and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>lives of men. Unfortunately, at the very time when new
power for evil was thus being placed in its hands by the action
of the synod and the General Court, the more conservative
leaders, both of Massachusetts and Connecticut, were lost to
their communities by death, and the dangerous weapons were
to be wielded by two of the most bigoted and blood-thirsty
fanatics whom either Old or New England had produced.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thomas Hooker died in 1647, as the work of the synod was
beginning, and John Winthrop in 1649, as it was ending.
There is no comparison in the debt that the political thought
of America owes to the two men, whose ideas have already
been contrasted on an earlier page. Hooker led the way
along which the people of the United States were to follow,
while Winthrop was engaged in the attempt to found a state
in a politically impossible form. In spite of his inestimable
services in the beginnings of the colony, there was no originality
in his contribution to thought, and his subservience to the
demands of the theocracy had been foreshadowed by his statement
in early manhood that he so honored a faithful minister
that he “could have kissed his feet.”<a id='r651'></a><a href='#f651' class='c014'><sup>[651]</sup></a> Of high nobility of
character, gentle, forgiving, frequently kindest to those from
whom he differed most, there was little in his nature of the
born persecutor. Led into acts of intolerant zeal by the ministers
whom he so devoutly followed, there is considerable probability
in the story related by Hutchinson, that when on his
death-bed, being pressed by Dudley to sign a warrant for the
banishment of a heretic, he refused, saying that “he had
done too much of that work already.”<a id='r652'></a><a href='#f652' class='c014'><sup>[652]</sup></a> His portrait depicts
a face of gentleness rather than of strength. His unquestioned
integrity, his modesty, and his self-sacrificing devotion to the
interests of the colony as he saw them, amply fulfilled the high
opinion which the original undertakers of the enterprise had
formed of him, although, as in the case of most of the leaders,
the effect upon mind and character of the transplanting to
America was not wholly a happy one. “He was of a more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>catholic spirit than some of his brethren before he left England,”
wrote Hutchinson; “but afterward he grew more contracted,
and was disposed to lay too great stress upon indifferent
matters.”<a id='r653'></a><a href='#f653' class='c014'><sup>[653]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The same effect had been felt in the case of John Cotton.
The most tolerant, as he was one of the ablest, of the Massachusetts
divines, we have already seen how he had started
upon the true path when, dismayed by the universal ecclesiastical
clamor raised by the Antinomian controversy, he
drew back, like Winthrop, and ever after submitted to smaller
men. Nevertheless, his death, some months after the final
adoption of the Cambridge Platform, removed the last of the
three men who by inclination and influence might have done
something to stay the theocracy from the course into which it
was soon to throw itself headlong. In place of Winthrop and
Cotton, its leaders became Endicott and Norton. Able, stern,
fiercely bigoted, absolutely convinced of their own infallibility
in interpreting the word of God, undeterred by doubt, and
unrestrained by pity, they were unwittingly to water the seeds
of liberty with the blood of their victims.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the midsummer of the year in which the Platform was
finally adopted by the Court, John <a id='corr259.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Clark'>Clarke</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_259.19'><ins class='correction' title='Clark'>Clarke</ins></a></span>, one of the ablest
citizens of Rhode Island, Obadiah Holmes, and John Crandall,
as representatives of the Baptist church of Newport, arrived
at Lynn to visit an aged member of that church, who was too
infirm to make a journey himself.<a id='r654'></a><a href='#f654' class='c014'><sup>[654]</sup></a> In 1644, a law had been
passed punishing with banishment anyone who should openly
or secretly speak against the orthodox Massachusetts doctrine
regarding baptism; and the three Baptists were at once arrested.<a id='r655'></a><a href='#f655' class='c014'><sup>[655]</sup></a>
<a id='corr259.27'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Clark'>Clarke</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_259.27'><ins class='correction' title='Clark'>Clarke</ins></a></span> was fined £20, Holmes £30, and Crandall £5,
in default of which they were to be whipped. The spirit of
the court that tried them is vividly shown by two incidents
as told by the prisoners themselves. <a id='corr259.30'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Clark'>Clarke</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_259.30'><ins class='correction' title='Clark'>Clarke</ins></a></span>, having asked by
what law he was punished, the penalty not being that prescribed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>by the ordinance of 1644, relates that Endicott “stept
up to us, and told us we had denyed Infants Baptism, and
being somewhat transported broke forth, and told me I had
deserved death, and said he would not have such trash brought
into this jurisdiction.”<a id='r656'></a><a href='#f656' class='c014'><sup>[656]</sup></a> Holmes, describing his own trial,
wrote that, when receiving sentence, “I exprest myself in these
words; I blesse God I am counted worthy to suffer for the
name of Jesus; whereupon John Wilson (their pastor as they
call him) strook me before the Judgment Seat, and cursed
me, saying, the Curse of God, or Jesus goe with thee.”<a id='r657'></a><a href='#f657' class='c014'><sup>[657]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Crandall, who had figured but little in the proceedings, was
released on bail; while, without his knowledge, some unknown
well-wisher paid Clark's fine. Holmes, however, refused to
pay his fine or allow others to pay it for him, and insisted upon
the sentence being executed in its full barbarity. Thirty
strokes, with a three-corded whip, were laid upon his bare back.
Two bystanders who, moved by pity, had the temerity to take
the prisoner by the hand as he left the whipping-post, were
themselves arrested and sentenced to pay forty shillings or
be whipped.<a id='r658'></a><a href='#f658' class='c014'><sup>[658]</sup></a> To one of them, who affirmed to Endicott that
he believed Holmes was a godly man and “carried himself as
did become a Christian,” the Governor threatened that “we
will deal with you as we have dealt with him.” “I am in the
hands of God,” the prisoner replied.</p>

<p class='c001'>The following year, Clark went to England with Williams
in regard to the Coddington matter in Rhode Island, and,
while there, published his account of the treatment the Baptists
had met with in Massachusetts.<a id='r659'></a><a href='#f659' class='c014'><sup>[659]</sup></a> As so often before, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>intolerance of the new country was severely criticized by its
friends in the old.<a id='r660'></a><a href='#f660' class='c014'><sup>[660]</sup></a> “It doth not a little grieve my spirit,”
wrote Saltonstall to Cotton and Wilson, “what sadd things
are reported dayly of your tyranny and persecution in New
England.... These rigid wayse have layd you very lowe in
the hearts of the saynts. I doe assure I have heard them pray
in the publique assemblies that the Lord would give you meeke
and humble spirits, not to stryve soe much for uniformity
as to keepe the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.”
He warns them “not to practice those courses in a wilderness,
which you went so farre to prevent”; and adds, “I hope you
doe not assume to yourselves infallibillities of judgment, when
the most learned of the Apostles confesseth he knew but in
parte.”<a id='r661'></a><a href='#f661' class='c014'><sup>[661]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In Cotton's reply, the ministers defended the acts of the
Court, and, speaking of the victims' imprisonment, Cotton
even descended so low as to write, “I believe they neither of
them fared better at home, and I am sure Holmes had not
been so well clad of many years before.” More interesting,
however, is his plain enunciation of the doctrine that they
alone knew the will of God and should lay it down for the
community, which we noted in an earlier chapter as one of
the outstanding characteristics of Puritanism in every age.
“There is a vast difference,” he wrote, “between men's inventions
and God's institutions; we fled from men's inventions,
to which we else should have been compelled; we compel
none to men's inventions.” The inference was, of course,
that, whatever the rest of mankind might think, any institution
decreed by the Massachusetts ministers was, <span lang="la"><i>ipso facto</i></span>,
God's. Therefore, “if the worship be lawful in itself, the
magistrate compelling him to come to it, compelleth him not
to sin, but the sin is in his own will that needs to be compelled
to a Christian duty.”<a id='r662'></a><a href='#f662' class='c014'><sup>[662]</sup></a> Four fifths of their fellow citizens
might refuse to join their churches; the noblest spirits among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>the Puritan element in England might plead with them; but
in vain. The theocracy had now reached such a height of
intellectual pride, of intolerable belief in themselves as the
sole possessors of the knowledge of God, and as the only legitimate
interpreters of his will to the world, that either all freedom
of thought in Massachusetts must die, or their power must be
destroyed. In that struggle, the ministers and the magistrates
were willing to shed unlimited blood. Fortunately,
noble men and women were not lacking to offer themselves
as victims that the liberty of God might be made manifest.</p>

<p class='c001'>The two who had dared to take Obadiah Holmes by the
hand, as, streaming with blood, he left the stake, were the
silent witnesses of a great body of liberal opinion. While the
ministers and magistrates were, of course, supported everywhere
by very considerable numbers among the narrower and
more zealous members of the churches, many causes were at
work to reduce their proportion in relation to the community
at large. Not only had the body of non-church members
always constituted the great majority of the population, but
even among the members themselves a new generation was
growing up, which had known nothing of the spiritual experiences
in England, and the struggle there against the established
Church. Such a struggle, as the Massachusetts authorities
were soon to find in the case of the Quakers, serves to
intensify the zeal of the innovators. But in Massachusetts,
the former innovators had become transformed into thoroughly
orthodox members of a state church, supported by the arm
of the civil power, enjoying all the comfortable, safe, and
deadening results of an “establishment.” Their faith being
no longer tried by opposition, the inevitable consequence was
a decline in interest and in zeal. This was recognized by the
ministers, and the rather curious situation resulted, in which
we find them adopting an apparently more liberal attitude
than the lay members themselves toward the question of
admission to membership. If, however, in the ministerial
convention of 1657 and the synod of 1662, the clergy were
rather the more anxious of the two to effect a compromise on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>that point,<a id='r663'></a><a href='#f663' class='c014'><sup>[663]</sup></a> the cause is not far to seek. Their power and
influence—and it must always be remembered that they
thought they were using both for the work of the Lord—were
dependent upon the maintenance of the numbers of the
Church, quite as much as upon that of strict conformity and
discipline. The theocracy was, in fact, in very unstable
equilibrium, and was equally in danger from an increase in
toleration or from a decrease in church-membership. It was
the preservation of their influence, from high motives as well
as from low, which was leading the clergy on the path to the
“Half-Way Covenant”; and the fact that they felt the need
of lowering the requirements for admission to the church is
the strongest sort of evidence as to the extent to which liberal
opinion had developed among the mass of laymen.</p>

<p class='c001'>If, however, the clergy were to make the attempt, on the one
hand, to prevent the numbers of their followers from declining,
by no longer requiring them to have passed through the experience
of conversion, on the other, they were about to engage
in the most determined effort yet made to enforce conformity
in matters of doctrine.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of all the sects that had arisen during the religious ferment
following the Reformation, none seems to have been more
misunderstood or to have encountered greater opposition
than the Quakers. In the middle of the seventeenth century,
both the beliefs and the practices of the sect were in an inchoate
state, and the vagaries of many of its adherents from
the lower walks of life seem not only to have called forth <a id='corr263.27'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='unparallelled'>unparalleled</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_263.27'><ins class='correction' title='unparallelled'>unparalleled</ins></a></span>
torrents of abuse from all quarters, but to have
made men fear that these inoffensive people were to repeat
the excesses of some of the frenzied sects of a century earlier.
These fears and prejudices were largely increased by the writings
of various ministers, many of whom were closely connected
with New England.<a id='r664'></a><a href='#f664' class='c014'><sup>[664]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Both the ideas and the carriage of the Quakers were such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>as to be especially repugnant to the leaders of the theocracy
in Massachusetts. Their democratic tendency and peculiarities
of social usage were extremely offensive to persons who
regarded themselves as an aristocracy of the Saints of God,
and who looked upon any lack of respect offered to magistrates
or ministers as little short of blasphemy. Moreover,
religion as professed by the Quakers was at the opposite
pole of thought and experience from that professed by
the Puritans. The latter looked upon the Bible as the only
complete and final revelation of God to man, of which the
minister was the official expounder. To them, the covenant
between man and God, the preaching of the word, the scrupulous
observance of the Sabbath and of the letter of the Judaic
laws, the hard-won privilege of receiving the Sacrament, were
all of the essence of religion. On the other hand, the Quakers
laid special stress upon the divine illumination in the individual
heart, and upon a continuing revelation of Himself by
God to man. They denied to the Bible the position assigned
to it by the Puritans, and were bitter in their denunciations of
“a hireling ministry.” To them the sacraments were shadows,
while their lives were saturated with the spirit of the New
Testament, not the Old. It was in this antithesis that lay
the real answer to George Bishop's question to the Massachusetts
magistrates, when he asked: “Why was it that the
coming of two women so shook ye, as if a formidable army
had invaded your borders?”<a id='r665'></a><a href='#f665' class='c014'><sup>[665]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Mary Fisher and Ann Austin, the two women in question,
arrived at Boston, from Barbadoes, in July, 1656, a few weeks
after Ann Hibbens had been hung as a witch.<a id='r666'></a><a href='#f666' class='c014'><sup>[666]</sup></a> Governor
Endicott was away at the time, but the Deputy Governor,
Bellingham, took charge of the proceedings which were immediately
begun against them. Their baggage was searched, and
a hundred volumes, considered heretical, were confiscated and
burned, without compensation. Although there was nothing
about their case to suggest witchcraft, the authorities had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>them stripped stark naked and examined for evidences, with
unnecessary indignities.<a id='r667'></a><a href='#f667' class='c014'><sup>[667]</sup></a> They were imprisoned, deprived of
light in their cell, and refused communication with anyone.
Finally, after five weeks of this illegal punishment, they were
shipped back to Barbadoes, fortunate in having escaped before
Endicott's return.</p>

<p class='c001'>Within a few days of their leaving, eight more Quakers
arrived on a ship from London, and were promptly accorded
similar treatment, except that witchcraft was not charged.<a id='r668'></a><a href='#f668' class='c014'><sup>[668]</sup></a>
Endicott's attitude was shown at once. “Take heed you
break not our Ecclesiastical Laws,” he said to them, “for then
ye are sure to stretch by a Halter.” At the trial, when they
asked for a copy of the laws against them, he refused to allow
them to see one—"to the grieving of the People then present,"
wrote our contemporary authority, “who said openly in the
Court—How shall they know then when they Transgress?”<a id='r669'></a><a href='#f669' class='c014'><sup>[669]</sup></a>
After some weeks' confinement, they were shipped back to
England, and the Massachusetts authorities addressed a letter
to the United Colonies, asking for the passage of a general regulation
against allowing “such pests” as Quakers to be admitted
to any of the colonies.<a id='r670'></a><a href='#f670' class='c014'><sup>[670]</sup></a> In October, the Massachusetts
General Court passed the first law specifically directed
against the sect, which provided that any master of a ship
bringing a known Quaker to Massachusetts should be fined
£100, and be required to give bonds for taking such out of the
colony again, in default of which he was to be imprisoned.
The Quaker was to be committed to the “house of correction,”
to be severely whipped, “kept constantly to worke,” and not
permitted to speak with anyone. If any resident of the colony
defended any Quaker opinion, he was to be fined or, on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>the third offense, banished; while any person “reviling” a
magistrate or minister, which meant criticizing them, was to
be fined or whipped.<a id='r671'></a><a href='#f671' class='c014'><sup>[671]</sup></a> Few bits of legislation can be more
complete than this, which thus provided punishment for an
offender, denied anyone the right to speak in his behalf, and
made it a crime to criticize the men who had passed the law.
One voice, nevertheless, was publicly raised on behalf of liberty.
Nicholas Upshall, “a weakly old man,” who, when the
two Quakeresses were being starved in prison, had bribed the
jailer to give them food, heard the new law being proclaimed
in the streets. He protested against it, and for his temerity in
daring to criticize the magistrates, he was fined £20, and
banished at the beginning of winter.<a id='r672'></a><a href='#f672' class='c014'><sup>[672]</sup></a> On his way to free
Rhode Island, he was offered a home by an Indian who took
pity upon him, and who, after hearing of his misfortune, exclaimed,
“What a God have the English who deal so with one
another about the worship of their God!”<a id='r673'></a><a href='#f673' class='c014'><sup>[673]</sup></a> Upshall, however,
continued his journey to Gorton's settlement, where he
was welcomed and cared for.</p>

<p class='c001'>The following year, a band of Quaker missionaries from
England landed at Newport, and were kindly received by the
Rhode Islanders.<a id='r674'></a><a href='#f674' class='c014'><sup>[674]</sup></a> This at once aroused the other colonies,
whose Commissioners wrote to the Rhode Island government
of the “prudent care” that Massachusetts had taken when
Quakers had sought her hospitality, and requested that government
to banish such Quakers as were already on the Island,
and to prohibit any more from coming, so that the “contagion”
might not spread. The letter ended with the threat that, if the
little colony did not take such action, “wee apprehend that it
will be our duty seriously to consider what further provision
God may call us to make to prevent the aforesaid mischiefe.”<a id='r675'></a><a href='#f675' class='c014'><sup>[675]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>To this bullying letter, Rhode Island sent an answer as
wise as it was dignified. After stating their desire to live in
loving correspondence with all the colonies, they wrote:—</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>“As concerning these quakers (so called), which are now
among us, we have no law among us, whereby to punish any
for only declaring by words, &#38;c., theire mindes and understandings
concerning the things and ways of God, as to salvation
and an eternal condition. And we, moreover, finde, that
in those places where these people aforesaid, in this colony,
are most of all suffered to declare themselves freely, and are
only opposed by arguments in discourse, there they least of
all desire to come, and we are informed that they begin to loath
this place for that they are not opposed by the civill authority,
but with all patience and meekness are suffered to say over
their pretended revelations and admonitions, nor are they like
or able to gain many here to their way; surely we find that they
delight to be persecuted by civill powers, and when they are
soe, they are like to gain more adherents by the conseyte of
their patient sufferings, than by consent to their pernicious
sayings: And yet we conceive, that theire doctrines tend to
very absolute cuttinge downe and overturninge relations and
civill government among men, if generally received.”<a id='r676'></a><a href='#f676' class='c014'><sup>[676]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The General Assembly sent a similar reply, some months
later, in which they stated that freedom of conscience was the
principal ground of their charter, “which freedom we still
prize as the greatest hapiness that men can possess in this
world”; and added that Quakers were “suffered to live in
England; yea even in the heart of the nation.”<a id='r677'></a><a href='#f677' class='c014'><sup>[677]</sup></a> Apparently
the only answer the United Colonies could make to the worldly
wisdom and nobility of their little neighbor, was to threaten
to cut off her trade and to deprive her of the necessities of life.<a id='r678'></a><a href='#f678' class='c014'><sup>[678]</sup></a>
Nor has the letter, which is one of the landmarks in the struggle
for religious liberty in America, fared better at the hands
of New England's clerical historians. Palfrey, who devotes
thirty-five pages to an extenuating account of the Massachusetts
persecution, conceals Rhode Island's stand in a footnote;
and Dr. Ellis speaks of that colony's protest as “a quaint letter,”
in which, incredibly, he finds only “naïveté and humor.”<a id='r679'></a><a href='#f679' class='c014'><sup>[679]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>Meanwhile, the other four colonies proceeded to pass more
stringent laws themselves, though those of Plymouth and
Connecticut were less severe than those of New Haven, where
the penalties rose to branding the letter H on the hands of
male Quakers, and boring the tongues of Quakeresses with a
red-hot iron.<a id='r680'></a><a href='#f680' class='c014'><sup>[680]</sup></a> This latter punishment, as well as the cutting
off of ears, was likewise added to the Massachusetts laws.<a id='r681'></a><a href='#f681' class='c014'><sup>[681]</sup></a> In
1658, the Commissioners of the United Colonies “seriously
comended” to the several colonies that they pass legislation
declaring that, if any Quaker, once banished, returned, the
offender should suffer death.<a id='r682'></a><a href='#f682' class='c014'><sup>[682]</sup></a> Massachusetts, however, which
was clearly behind the suggestion, was the only colony that
did so. Connecticut, which was lenient in its treatment, had
but little trouble, and Governor Winthrop of that colony told
the Massachusetts magistrates that he would go down on his
bare knees to beg that they would not execute the death-penalty.
Plymouth was more influenced by its powerful
neighbor, and one of the magistrates, deposed for his toleration
of the sect, wrote of the persecution in Massachusetts,
“we expect that we must do the like, we must dance after
their Pipe; now Plymouth-Saddle is upon the Bay-Horse.”<a id='r683'></a><a href='#f683' class='c014'><sup>[683]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In spite of a petition signed by twenty-five names, which
was presented to the General Court in Boston, asking for
severer laws against the Quakers,<a id='r684'></a><a href='#f684' class='c014'><sup>[684]</sup></a> and which was probably
inspired by the Reverend John Norton, there was a strong
sentiment in the colony against such action. The cruel sufferings
that the authorities by this time had inflicted upon Mary
Dyer, Mary Clark, Christopher Holden, the Southwicks,
Richard Dowdney, and many others, and their patience under
affliction, were telling heavily in favor of the Quakers and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>against the clergy.<a id='r685'></a><a href='#f685' class='c014'><sup>[685]</sup></a> In the case of William Brend, the people
became so aroused as temporarily to frighten the authorities
in their mad course. He had been put “into Irons, Neck and
Heels, lockt so close together, as there was no more room
between each, than for the Horse-Lock that fastened them
on”; and was kept in that way for sixteen hours, without food,
after having been whipped. The next day he was whipped
again with a tarred rope, so severely that the rope untwisted;
but a new one was procured, and he was given ninety-seven
more blows. “His Flesh was beaten Black, and as into a
Gelly; and under his Arms the bruised Flesh and Blood hung
down, clodded as it were in Baggs.” The next morning, after
threatening to give him more, the Puritan jailer went to church.
Brend, who had then been some days without food, finally
became unconscious. The people, learning the facts, protested
loudly, and a tumult was raised. Endicott sent “his
Chyrurgion, to see what might be done (such Fear was fallen
upon you,” writes our authority, “lest ye should suffer for
his Blood) who thought it impossible according unto Men
that he should live, but that his Flesh would Rot from off his
Bones, ere that bruised Flesh could be brought to digest (this
was the Judgment of your Governors Chirurgion), and such a
cry was made by the People that came in to see him, that ye
were constrained, for the satisfaction of them, to set up a
Paper at your Meeting-House-Door, and up and down the
Streets, That the Jaylor should be dealt withal the next Court;
but it was soon taken down again, upon the instigation of
John Norton (your High-Priest unto whom, as the Fountain
or Principal, most of the Cruelty and Bloodshed herein rehearsed,
is to be imputed) and the Jaylor let alone: For, said
John Norton (but how Cruelly let the Sober judge)—W.
Brend endeavored to beat our Gospel-Ordinances black and
blue; and if he was beaten black and blue, it was Just upon
him; and said he would appear in the Jaylor's behalf.”<a id='r686'></a><a href='#f686' class='c014'><sup>[686]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It is not intended to go into all the details of the many other
and, happily, somewhat less terrible cases of the persecution;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>and the above extract from a contemporary has been given
because the grim realities of the past are apt to be blurred by
our easy modern phrases.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Reverend John Norton, the Reverend Charles Chauncey,
and other divines, as well as the Governor and other leading
laymen, continued to press for a law allowing them to
execute the death-penalty legally. The struggle, as usual,
ranged the people against the theocratical leaders, and the
deputies refused to pass the law prepared by the clergy and
voted by the magistrates, which not only imposed death upon
any Quaker who should return after banishment, but denied
the right of trial by jury, and relegated the cases to a court
composed of three magistrates, a majority of whom could
impose the penalty.<a id='r687'></a><a href='#f687' class='c014'><sup>[687]</sup></a> The House of Deputies, which contained
twenty-six members, finally consented to the passage of the
law, somewhat amended, by a majority of one, owing to the
absence, on account of illness, of one of those who had opposed
the bill.<a id='r688'></a><a href='#f688' class='c014'><sup>[688]</sup></a> In view of the severe penalties imposed upon all
who might speak in defense of Quaker doctrines, the thirteen
who stood out to the end deserve all praise.</p>

<p class='c001'>Immediate steps were taken to influence public opinion in
favor of the new law, and Norton was appointed by the Court
to write a treatise in support of it, which was published the
following year.<a id='r689'></a><a href='#f689' class='c014'><sup>[689]</sup></a> Meanwhile, the persecution continued unabated.
At the same court at which the law was passed, six
Quakers were banished on pain of death, and four months
later, the children of two of them, Daniel and Provided Southwick,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>were ordered sold into bondage in Virginia or the West
Indies, by the County Treasurer, to pay the accumulated fines
imposed upon them for not attending a Puritan church. No
ship's captain, however, sufficiently hardened in the religion
of New England could be found to share in the guilt of this
transaction.<a id='r690'></a><a href='#f690' class='c014'><sup>[690]</sup></a> There is no need of going into the details of
the other cases, which were soon overshadowed by those of the
martyrs who voluntarily suffered the extreme penalty, in order
to testify to the truth as they saw it, and to die for liberty of
opinion.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is no doubt that Mary Dyer, William Robinson, and
Marmaduke Stevenson had counted the full cost when they
returned from banishment to face certain death, in the autumn
of 1659. Sentence was pronounced on the eighteenth of October,
and the execution took place a few days later.<a id='r691'></a><a href='#f691' class='c014'><sup>[691]</sup></a> On
the petition of her son, Mary Dyer had been reprieved, and
was once more banished; but with a fiendish ingenuity of
cruelty, she was not to know of it, and was to be led to the
gallows with a rope about her neck, and to wait while the two
men were being hung. As they were led to execution, the
three walked hand in hand. “Are you not ashamed to walk
between two young men?” asked the Puritan marshal, with
characteristic coarseness. “It is an hour of the greatest joy
I can enjoy in this world,” answered the pure-hearted woman.
“No eye can see, no ear can hear, no tongue can speak, no
heart can understand, the sweet incomes and refreshing of the
spirit of the Lord which I now enjoy.”<a id='r692'></a><a href='#f692' class='c014'><sup>[692]</sup></a> After the others had
died, her hands and legs were bound, her face covered, and
the rope adjusted around her neck. At that moment her
reprieve was announced to her. She refused to accept her life,
but was taken to Rhode Island by her family. The following
spring, however, she returned and told the General Court that
she was to bear witness against the unjust law, which this
time was allowed to take its course.<a id='r693'></a><a href='#f693' class='c014'><sup>[693]</sup></a> A few months later,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>another Quaker, William Leddra, suffered the same penalty.</p>

<p class='c001'>So far, in the Puritan colonies, mainly in Massachusetts,
over forty had been whipped, sixty-four imprisoned, over
forty banished, one branded, three had had their ears cut off,
five had had the right of appeal to England denied them,
four had been put to death, while many others had suffered
in diverse ways.<a id='r694'></a><a href='#f694' class='c014'><sup>[694]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>There are many contemporary evidences, however, to show
that the sympathy of the people went out more and more to
the victims. At the time of the execution of Robinson and
Stevenson, a heavy guard had been necessary to allow the
sentence to be carried out, and the Court had found it needful
to prepare a long defense of their action against such as might
feel “pitty and comiseration,” and others who might look
upon the magistrates as “bloody persecutors.” Apologetic
broadsides were printed to the same effect.<a id='r695'></a><a href='#f695' class='c014'><sup>[695]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>While the trial of Leddra was in progress, a banished Quaker,
Wenlock Christison, suddenly appeared in court, and after
declaring his identity, looked into the stern face of Endicott,
and solemnly said to him, “I am come here to warn you
that you should shed no more innocent blood, for the blood
that you have shed already, cries to the Lord for vengeance to
come upon you.”<a id='r696'></a><a href='#f696' class='c014'><sup>[696]</sup></a> He was immediately arrested, and at his
trial protested that the colony had no authority to make laws
repugnant to the laws of England, and that there was no
law there providing for capital punishment against Quakers.
But by this time even the magistrates had begun to hesitate
in their course, and several refused to vote for his death.
Endicott, in a fury, pounded the table, and ordered another
vote, thundering out, “You that will not consent, record it:
I thank God I am not afraid to give judgment.” It is said
that the result was uncertain, and that the Governor himself
precipitately passed the sentence of death.<a id='r697'></a><a href='#f697' class='c014'><sup>[697]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>The sentence, however, was never executed. Not only
had the people of Massachusetts now risen in revolt against
the persecuting tyranny of the ministers and magistrates, but
the colony was to be stayed in its course by a stronger power.
The English monarchy had been restored a year before, and
the relations of Massachusetts to the mother-country were
about to undergo a marked change.</p>

<p class='c001'>Complaints had been made to King Charles of the persecutions
in New England, and word of this had been received
privately in Massachusetts. Partly from fear of his possible
action, and partly in deference to the evident opposition of
the people, a new law was passed, which, while still preserving
the death-penalty, evidently intended to make it less necessary
of enforcement.<a id='r698'></a><a href='#f698' class='c014'><sup>[698]</sup></a> Under this new act, Christison and twenty-seven
others were released from prison, though two were
stripped to the waist, and whipped through the town.<a id='r699'></a><a href='#f699' class='c014'><sup>[699]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>On receiving news of Leddra's death, Edward Burrough,
an English Quaker, had secured an audience with the King,
and told him that “there was a vein of innocent blood opened
in his dominions, which if it were not stopped would overrun
all”; to which the monarch answered, “but I will stop that
vein.” His secretary was called, and an order at once prepared
to be sent to the Massachusetts government. As no
royal ship was then sailing, the Quakers hired one and dispatched
the “king's missive,” by Samuel Shattuck, a banished
Massachusetts Quaker. In six weeks, the condemned man,
now a King's messenger, confronted Endicott, and delivered
the letter, ordering that no further proceedings be taken
against Quakers, and that such as were under charges be sent
to England. Endicott read it, and with what must have been
the most painful emotion of his life, he looked at the hated
heretic and said, “We shall obey his Majesty's commands.”<a id='r700'></a><a href='#f700' class='c014'><sup>[700]</sup></a>
Orders were issued for the release of all Quakers, and Shattuck,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>speaking of the colonists, said that “many mouths are now
opened, which were before shutt, and some of them now say,
Its the welcomest ship that ever came into the land.”<a id='r701'></a><a href='#f701' class='c014'><sup>[701]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Though no more of the sect were put to death, their persecution
was by no means ended. The new law had provided that
every Quaker should be apprehended, stripped from the waist
up, tied to a cart's tail, and whipped through every town to
the boundary of the colony. This was to be repeated if they
returned, and on the fourth offense they were to be branded,
and, on the fifth, banished on pain of death.<a id='r702'></a><a href='#f702' class='c014'><sup>[702]</sup></a> This law was
modified by limiting the whippings to three towns only, in 1662,
although an answer to the address of Massachusetts to the
King had been received some months earlier, withdrawing
much of the royal protection formerly offered to the Quakers.<a id='r703'></a><a href='#f703' class='c014'><sup>[703]</sup></a>
The change was evidently due, therefore, to public sentiment
in the colony. Of the barbarous treatment accorded the
victims under the act, it is unnecessary to speak in detail.
To mention one of the worst cases, we may note that three
women were stripped to the waist, tied to the cart's tail, and,
in the end of December, forced to tramp through deep snow,
receiving ten lashes on their bare backs in eleven successive
towns.<a id='r704'></a><a href='#f704' class='c014'><sup>[704]</sup></a> The end, however, was not far off. In 1665, Endicott
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>died, and the Royal Commissioners also commanded the
Massachusetts General Court not to molest Quakers in their
secular business.<a id='r705'></a><a href='#f705' class='c014'><sup>[705]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Although a considerable body of opinion had, undoubtedly,
been throughout in favor of the course taken by the ministers
and magistrates,<a id='r706'></a><a href='#f706' class='c014'><sup>[706]</sup></a> all the evidence points to a large and increasing
body against it. The facts that the deputies were
opposed to it, that the Court, usually somewhat arrogant in
the assertion of its authority, had to stoop to public explanations
and propaganda, that even the magistrates finally revolted,
and that in the last case, the death-penalty could not
be enforced even when passed, all indicate clearly enough the
refusal of the people to follow their ministers in their frantic
efforts to maintain orthodoxy at any cost.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is needless to say that the seventeenth century cannot be
judged by the standards of the nineteenth, but the second
half of the earlier one was by no means as intolerant as many
would have us believe. Opinion in England and in all of the
colonies, although naturally bigoted as yet, on the part of
many, was, beyond question, becoming far more liberal. We
have already noted the frequent remonstrances addressed to
Massachusetts by her friends at home. We have seen the
consistent stand of Rhode Island from the start, and noted
the tolerant tendencies in Plymouth and Connecticut. In
England, Vane was raising his voice in Parliament for religious
liberty in its most extreme form.<a id='r707'></a><a href='#f707' class='c014'><sup>[707]</sup></a> In the same body, Cromwell
was asking, “Is it ingenuous to ask liberty and not to give
it? What greater hypocrisy than for those who were opposed
by the Bishops to become the greatest oppressors themselves,
as soon as their yoke was removed.”<a id='r708'></a><a href='#f708' class='c014'><sup>[708]</sup></a> Maryland had possessed
religious freedom for all professing Christ, since 1649, and in
1665 the New Jersey Concession provided for complete liberty
of conscience, as did the charter of South Carolina four years
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>later.<a id='r709'></a><a href='#f709' class='c014'><sup>[709]</sup></a> In Jamaica, toleration, with full civil liberties to all
Christians, including Quakers, was proclaimed in 1662.<a id='r710'></a><a href='#f710' class='c014'><sup>[710]</sup></a> Public
opinion notoriously outruns legislation, yet in addition to the
above examples and others, Pennsylvania, in 1682, provided
in its laws for equal liberty for all who believed in God; while
the Toleration Act, a landmark in the struggle in England,
was passed seven years later.<a id='r711'></a><a href='#f711' class='c014'><sup>[711]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The progress made in the generation since Bradford and his
little band had tried to flee secretly from England had been
great. A large section of the people, however, both at home
and in the colonies, was undoubtedly as bigoted and intolerant
as ever; and, unfortunately, the leaders in charge of the
destinies of the largest of the New England colonies at the
critical period we have been describing were numbered among
them. They had made a desperate stand, and hesitated at
nothing,—not even inflicting torture and taking human life,—in
order to maintain their position; and, happily for America,
they had been defeated, though not until they had set an indelible
stain on the pages of American history.</p>

<p class='c001'>The struggle we have been describing has not been related
at length because of its antiquarian or dramatic interest. In
toleration of opinions lies the one hope for the advancement
of the human race. If the earthly end of man “is the highest
and most harmonious development of his powers to a complete
and consistent whole,”<a id='r712'></a><a href='#f712' class='c014'><sup>[712]</sup></a> free scope must be provided for differing
opinion, and varieties in the experiment of living. The
contest in Massachusetts happened to be fought out on religious
lines, because it was an age of religious interests. It happened
to be fought against the ministers and magistrates because,
in that time and place, they represented the forces opposed to
freedom and to change. But there are other elements in man's
nature than religion; and tyranny and opposition to all innovation
may be as securely enthroned in the public opinion of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>democracy as in the leaders of a theocracy. So far as experience
has shown, they are certain to be, in a socialistic or communistic
state; and the battle for toleration of opinion, for
the liberty of the individual personality to expand along its
own unique lines, for the chance of any further development
in the possibilities for the advancement of the race, may have
to be fought out again upon a grander scale than any the world
has yet seen.</p>

<p class='c001'>That the course which the Massachusetts authorities took
was wholly unnecessary was proved by the events in the other
colonies. What happened was largely the consequence of
their own acts. Rhode Island had shown the just, and, at
the same time, the wise course to pursue. As she pointed out,
wherever Quakers were not persecuted, they gave no trouble.
One of the glories of the present nation is its complete toleration,
in so far, at least, as religion is concerned; and its hard-won
liberty is in no small measure due to the people of its
smallest state, and to the noble men and women who suffered
and gave their lives that the power of the Massachusetts
theocracy might be broken, and the human mind unshackled.
The debt which, in other ways, America owes to the largest
of the Puritan colonies is too great to require that aught but
the truth be told. It is not necessary to exalt erring and
fallible men to the rank of saints in order to show our gratitude
to them or our loyalty to our country. But the leaders and
citizens of Rhode Island, the martyred Quakers, and the men
and women of Massachusetts and the other colonies, who so
lived and wrought and died that the glory of an heritage of
intellectual freedom might be ours, are the Americans whom, in
the struggle we have been reciting, it should be our duty to
honor.</p>

is open for any to read in their legislative enactments and state documents. Many

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XII <br> <br> THE THEORY OF EMPIRE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In the last chapter we mentioned the change that was to
take place in the relations between New England and the
mother-country in the years following the Restoration. That
change was one of practical politics rather than of theory, which
latter had been but little altered from the beginning of the
colonial settlement, although the exigencies of events in England
had largely prevented its being translated into a consistent
course of action. In order to understand the imperial
theory of the day, and to appraise the wisdom and justice of
the positions taken both by England and by her colonies, it
is necessary to shift our standpoint temporarily, and to study
the empire from its centre, and not from one of its less important
outposts. Business men in contact with large affairs are
familiar with the relations that exist between the central administrative
office of a great corporation—whose sources of
raw materials, producing plants, and selling agencies may be
scattered over half a continent—and the local manager of
one of its units. If we consult the latter, we may learn of
local conditions as they affect him, and, perhaps, of his grievances
against the policy of the corporation; but if we would
properly understand the whole situation, we must study it at
the centre of the entire complicated system.</p>

<p class='c001'>The New England colonies were but parts, and, at this
period, unimportant parts, of such a system. Not only can
their history not be understood, if we attempt to trace it without
reference to England, but neither can their relations with
that country, unless we take the entire colonial organization
into account. The colonies were not independent states.<a id='r713'></a><a href='#f713' class='c014'><sup>[713]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>They were not even, primarily, independent states in the
making. The fact that a few of them, which happened to
have a continent at their back and unlimited room for expansion,
revolted after a century and a half, has tended to obscure
their real contemporary relation to England, much as the
refraction of water alters the apparent position of objects
under it when seen from an angle. The angle from which we
Americans always look at the original colonies is that of our
present independent nation; but by doing so we unwittingly
shift their position from integral parts of a complicated imperial
system to incipient independent commonwealths, assumed to
have been unjustly held in thraldom. Needless to say, such
a viewpoint vitiates our appraisal of every contemporary act
and opinion. It is possible that after some hundreds of years
the present United States may be divided into two or more
nations; but to-day they form one system, and no one would
think of interpreting the present relations between North and
South, or East and West, in the light of a possible separation
centuries hence. In the same way, the relations between
England and her colonies in the seventeenth century should be
interpreted in the light of their then actual and prospective
union and the political theories current, and not in that of a
subsequent, and more or less accidental, separation, and of the
wholly different theories of a later age.<a id='r714'></a><a href='#f714' class='c014'><sup>[714]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>When James I ascended the throne of England, the British
Empire was not in existence. The map of the world would
have been searched in vain for any settlement of English men
on English soil outside of the British Isles. When, less than
half a dozen decades later, the third Stuart returned from
“his travels,” amidst the acclaims of the nation, it was to
become the head of an empire which already encircled the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>globe. From Newfoundland to the Caribbean, English colonies
stretched in a great arc upon islands and mainland, while the
Bermudas, equidistant, roughly speaking, from all its parts,
formed a strategic centre far out in the Atlantic. Across that
ocean, Fort Comantine on the coast of Guinea protected the
African slave-trade, and the fortified island of St. Helena was
a half-way station for the Indian fleets. Passing around the
Cape, the next English possession was Gombroon, on the
Persian Gulf; while, still farther east, in India, lay the factories
on the Madras and Bombay shores and the Bay of Bengal.
Beyond those, again, English traders were permanently established
on Sumatra, Java, and the Celebes. Such an imperial
structure could not have been raised in less than the
allotted three-score years and ten of individual life by a practice
wholly tyrannical, or a colonial theory wholly false.</p>

<p class='c001'>The great trans-oceanic empires which were attempted in
the seventeenth century by the leading European powers were
political phenomena of an absolutely new type. Neither the
colonies of the city-states of Greece, nor the slow continental
expansion of Rome offered any adequate parallel to the political
results of the age of discovery, or any solutions of the
problems created.<a id='r715'></a><a href='#f715' class='c014'><sup>[715]</sup></a> Of those new empires, the English not
only has proved the most lasting and the greatest, but has
secured, from its very beginning, the largest comparative
amount of freedom to the colonists. Assertions have often
been made that its development has been unintentional and
unconscious; that the English race, as the phrase goes, has
peopled half the world in a fit of absence of mind. This is
true only in the sense that the Empire's growth has been slow,
normal, and unhurried, and that its strength has lain in the
character of the people rather than in any consistent policy
of aggression upon the part of their rulers. That it has been
unconscious in the sense that it has been unobserved is, of
course, disproved by the contemporary literature relating to
imperial problems in almost every decade from the sixteenth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>century to the present day; while the wars of the entire seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries were largely caused by trade
and colonial questions.<a id='r716'></a><a href='#f716' class='c014'><sup>[716]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Englishmen could not emigrate to distant parts of the world,
and found settlements, without, in many and serious ways,
involving the English nation—and that apart from the fact
that the soil on which the most populous of the colonies grew
up was the unquestioned property of the English Crown.
From the very beginning of colonization, therefore, even before
any permanent success had been achieved, we find the question
being discussed as to what use, if any, to the English people were
these distant settlements, with their possible disadvantages and
certain responsibilities.<a id='r717'></a><a href='#f717' class='c014'><sup>[717]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>If the establishment of the British Empire was not the result
of absent-mindedness, neither was it prompted by motives of
philanthropy toward generations yet unborn in countries overseas.
Exploration, settlement, far-distant foreign trade, ensuing
wars with competing powers, and the policing of trade-routes,
were costly and hazardous matters, and not to be undertaken
without the prospect of very tangible rewards of one sort
or another. As we endeavored to show in an earlier chapter,
the main underlying motive that led to the great discoveries
of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and, in the main, to
the colonizing movements of the seventeenth, was economic.
It was, therefore, entirely natural that the speculation as to
the advantages and disadvantages of empire, and as to the
relations of England to her dependencies, should be based upon
the economic theories of the day. The question, moreover,
as to what advantages, if any, would accrue from founding, or
allowing to be founded, colonies not yet in existence, was almost
necessarily, what those advantages would be for England
herself. After the Empire had come into existence, the point
of view shifted somewhat, and, theoretically, the question became
one of what advantage a policy might prove to the Empire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>as a whole, although, as its greatest aggregation of wealth and
population, the source of protection, the seat of power, the
centre of all exchanges, in a word, the heart of empire, the
local interests of England would still outweigh those of any
of the dependencies. In no case would those at the head of
the imperial government, aside from selfish motives, of which
there were plenty, have thought it the part of either wisdom or
justice to uphold the citizens of any one colony in a course
that seemed to run counter to the interests of the Empire as
a whole.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have already noted how the breaking up of the unity of
Christendom by the development of state churches was but a
phase of the operation of new forces at work, at the beginning
of the modern era, which were moulding men's thoughts and
emotions along national lines. In their religious aspect, these
gave rise to the post-Reformation churches, and in their
political aspect, to the growth of the modern state. They were
equally powerful in the economic field; and the so-called
Mercantile Theory, which was the ground of the imperial
theories of the time, was but the reasoned expression of this
nationalizing of the economic life of the peoples. In the
Middle Ages, the life of the individual, in its various relations,
had been decentralized. In his political allegiance he had
looked one way, in his religious another, and in his economic
still another. The growing strength of the feeling of nationality
was gradually drawing all toward a common centre.</p>

<p class='c001'>The balance of trade, which forms one of the essential
features of the Mercantile Theory, was not a new conception.
It was, however, of great practical influence upon economic
doctrine and state policies when applied to the nations. After
speaking of how a merchant balances his private books, and
how the head of a family looks after his estate, an early writer
goes on to say that “the Royall Merchant, the Regall Father
of that great family of a Kingdom, if He will know the Estate
of his Kingdome, Hee will compare the Gaine thereof with the
Expense; that is, the Native Commodities issued and sent
out, with the Forraine Commodities received in; and if it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>appeare that the Forraine Commodities doe exceed the Native,
either he must increase the Native, or lessen the Forraine,
or else looke for nothing else, but the Decay of Trade and
therein the losse of his Revenue, and Impoverishing of his
People.”<a id='r718'></a><a href='#f718' class='c014'><sup>[718]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This theory was developed into a system by Mun, who
affirmed that the best method to “increase our wealth and
treasure is by Forraign Trade, wherein wee must ever observe
this rule; to sell more to strangers yearly than wee consume
of theirs in value.”<a id='r719'></a><a href='#f719' class='c014'><sup>[719]</sup></a> The effects of this doctrine were vastly
increased and modified by the current belief that the precious
metals constituted the real wealth of a kingdom, and that its
whole trade, therefore, should be considered mainly in reference
to the resultant balance with foreigners in gold and silver.
For example, Mun states that if pepper be worth twenty
pence in Amsterdam, and threepence in the East Indies, it is
a gain to the nation to buy it in the latter, even though the
freight and other charges make it cost more in England than
if it were imported from Holland, because those charges are
paid by Englishmen to Englishmen, so that only threepence
in actual coin leaves the country, as compared with twenty.
In this particular, he points out, his countrymen “must ever
distinguish between the gain of the kingdom, and the profit of
the Merchant.”<a id='r720'></a><a href='#f720' class='c014'><sup>[720]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The effect of this theory upon the questions of colonization
and colonial policy was profound. “I conceive, no forein Plantation
should be undertaken or prosecuted,” wrote Samuel Fortrey,
“but in such countreys that may increase the wealth
and trade of this nation, either in furnishing us, with what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>we are otherwise forced to purchase from strangers, or else by
increasing such commodities, as are vendible abroad; which
may both increase our shipping, and profitably employ our
people; but otherwise, it is always carefully to be avoided,
especially where the charge is greater than the profit, for we
want not already a countrey sufficient for double our people,
were they rightly employed; and a Prince is more powerfull
that hath his strength and force united, then he that is weakly
scattered in many places.”<a id='r721'></a><a href='#f721' class='c014'><sup>[721]</sup></a> Granted the assumptions that
real wealth consists only of the precious metals, and that,
in a country without mines, these can be acquired only as a
result of a favorable trade with strangers, the colonial theory
of the European nations in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries was as logical as it was patriotic. The assumptions
may have been wrong, but in this, as in so many other cases,
we must remember that delusions are “as effective in social
evolution as are unassailable facts.”<a id='r722'></a><a href='#f722' class='c014'><sup>[722]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The <span lang="la"><i>pacte coloniale</i></span>, therefore, was, in some of its aspects,
similar to the ideal of the modern “trust,” which would combine
in one enormous organization the sources of its raw
materials, its means of transportation, manufacturing plants,
and selling agencies. The ideal empire, according to the
Mercantile Theory, would embrace the home country, which,
aside from the production of certain raw materials, was, in
the main, the source of credit, the seat of manufactures, the
selling agency to the world for the whole empire, the centre of
administration, and the protective power to guard the system.
The colonies in the temperate zone were to supply the typical
products of their regions, the East and West Indies materials
found in the tropics, and the African stations the supply of
negro labor.</p>

<p class='c001'>It must be distinctly remembered that this was not merely
an English ideal. It was the end toward which the most
advanced European nations were striving in building up their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>empires according to what was then considered as unquestionably
the soundest economic doctrine. France, under Colbert,
was endeavoring, with a logical rigor that was not equaled by
the English, to erect just such a completely balanced system.
She, too, had her North American temperate-zone colony in
Canada, her fishing fleets off Newfoundland, her West Indian
possessions, her African supply in Senegal, and her factories
in the East Indies.<a id='r723'></a><a href='#f723' class='c014'><sup>[723]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Such a system, closed against the world, presupposed that
every part would be willing to subordinate itself to the theoretical
needs of the whole, and that the production of every unit
could be so nicely adjusted in nature and amount as to maintain
the internal balances, and allow the home country, as
the selling agency, to establish a favorable balance with the
world external to the empire. Although some of the nations,
notably England and France, were able to block out empires
so located, as to their parts, as apparently to fulfil the requirements,
no such perfect adjustment of colonial production could
ever be reached as to fit the needs of the theory; while its
logic, seemingly so perfect, left out of account the fact that the
colonists were human beings, who would surely develop their
own local interests, troubles, and aspirations, and not insensible
parts of a great machine.</p>

<p class='c001'>The English Empire was the most complete embodiment of
the ideal. The factories in the Spice Islands and on the coasts
of India supplied the products of the Orient, not to be obtained
elsewhere. Africa provided the negroes, upon whose labor was
based the production of sugar in the West Indies, which formed
one of the mainstays of the Empire's commerce. St. Helena
and Bermuda were strategic points on the Indian and American
trade-routes. Virginia and Maryland were wholly devoted
to the staple crop of tobacco, which was another of the important
elements in British trade. The fisheries of Newfoundland
provided England with an article to exchange with the Catholic
countries of southern Europe for the wine, salt, and other products
imported from them; and they fitted in perfectly with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>the imperial scheme.<a id='r724'></a><a href='#f724' class='c014'><sup>[724]</sup></a> All these distant possessions, by
employing an increasing amount of shipping, under the laws
to be mentioned later, built up the merchant fleet upon which
rested England's naval power and her ability to defend the
Empire; while all of them consumed English manufactured
goods.</p>

<p class='c001'>New England, however, did not fit into this elaborate and
delicately adjusted trade-machine. In spite of her enormous
forest-resources, which had been counted upon to provide the
Empire with naval stores and timber, she failed utterly in
competition with the countries on the Baltic.<a id='r725'></a><a href='#f725' class='c014'><sup>[725]</sup></a> Her agricultural
products were practically identical with those of the old
country, and so competed with them. There was no staple
crop, like sugar or tobacco, to form an element of imperial
commerce. Her fisheries, which had loomed so large at the
time of the first settlement, served, for various reasons, only
to compete with those of Newfoundland, and at once to reduce
England's profits and to retard the increase of her fishing fleet.
The purely colonial shipping, which the New England colonies
early produced, drew away English seamen, competed with
English vessels, and reduced the naval strength of the mother-country.
Following the economic crisis of 1640, Massachusetts
and her sister colonies made strenuous and partly successful
efforts to establish home manufactures, which curtailed the
market for English goods.<a id='r726'></a><a href='#f726' class='c014'><sup>[726]</sup></a> As, even then, those colonies imported
much more from England than they exported to her,
they had to seek an outlet for such products as were not adapted
for the English trade, in order to obtain the money to settle
their English bills. The West Indian colonies, on the other
hand, exported to England far more than they imported.
Consequently New England sold her timber and provisions
to the island settlements, and used their bills of exchange to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>pay her English debts. In this, however, she seemed to be in
part merely drawing away the trade-balance of the West
Indies by increasing her competition with the home-country.<a id='r727'></a><a href='#f727' class='c014'><sup>[727]</sup></a>
Nor, as the shrewd and thrifty New England merchants grew
in numbers and in wealth, did the English West Indian islands
afford them sufficient outlet for their commercial energies;
and there gradually developed that system of trade with the
French island-group which was to be one of the causes of the
Revolution.<a id='r728'></a><a href='#f728' class='c014'><sup>[728]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>When we add to this economic maladjustment, according
to the current theory, the unique position of the New England
colonies as chartered or practically independent governments,
it is obvious how anomalous their relations were to the imperial
scheme. From the standpoint of contemporary opinion, it
was not unnatural that they should be regarded by many as
“the unfortunate results of misdirected efforts.” Nor was it
merely that they failed to fit in with the rest of the Empire.
As they grew in population, and in their avowed independence
of all external control of any sort, many an Englishman must
have felt the fear expressed by one of the ablest economic
writers of the latter part of the Empire's first century. Of all
the American plantations, D'Avenant wrote in 1698, New
England “is the most proper for building ships and breeding
seamen, and their soil affords plenty of cattle; besides which,
they have good fisheries, so that, if we should go to cultivate
among them the art of navigation, and teach them to have a
naval force, they may set up for themselves, and make the
greatest part of our West-Indian Trade precarious,” as well as
absorbing the colonial carrying trade and merchandizing.<a id='r729'></a><a href='#f729' class='c014'><sup>[729]</sup></a> It
has, indeed, been conjectured that Cromwell's attempt, in
1665, to induce a large number of the New Englanders to
emigrate to the newly conquered island of Jamaica derived
directly from the failure of their colonies to fit into the mercantile
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>empire,<a id='r730'></a><a href='#f730' class='c014'><sup>[730]</sup></a> although, to the present writer, other economic
and military motives seem quite as likely.<a id='r731'></a><a href='#f731' class='c014'><sup>[731]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>From this theory of empire sprang certain practical corollaries.
In part to avoid allowing foreigners to benefit from
the imperial trade, and to retain the carrying profits within
the Empire, but mainly to build up the merchant fleet, it was
decreed that all goods must be transported in vessels belonging
to the mother-country or her colonies. Foreign goods, according
to the theory, would have to be excluded as far as possible
from the colonial markets, the products of the latter limited
to the English market, and colonial manufacturing restrained
so as not to compete with home-made goods, although the
theory was never fully translated into practice. On the other
hand, as a partial offset to such laws as were passed, which
mainly redounded to the benefit of England so far as their
direct results were concerned, colonial produce was, to some
extent, given preferential treatment in that country, and, in
some important particulars, Englishmen were forbidden to
compete with the colonists. The colonies were also afforded
protection against the aggression of foreign nations. No
colony could possibly have remained independent. The choice
was not between the English Empire and independence, but
between being subject to Protestant and, as the world went
then, liberal England, or to Catholic France or Spain.</p>

<p class='c001'>As we have already said, in the second half of the seventeenth
century, Colbert, the great minister of Louis XIV, was
applying the Mercantile doctrine to the upbuilding of the
French overseas empire with a rigor that the English never attained.
When he excluded all foreign vessels from the French
colonial carrying-trade, there was, as yet, no sufficient French
merchant fleet to serve colonial needs, and the West India
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>planters were brought to the verge of starvation and ruin. If
they “were hungry, barefooted and in rags,” writes the historian
of Colbert's policy, “they must count these things as a
bit of temporary suffering, to be endured for the upbuilding of
French commerce. They must wait for the law of supply and
demand to operate and bring them, sooner or later, an abundance
from France.... But he was demanding too much.
What meant the noble idea of restoring French commerce and
the upbuilding of a mighty colonial empire to the planters in
the West Indies, whose empty bellies were crying for food,
whose nakedness demanded to be clothed?”<a id='r732'></a><a href='#f732' class='c014'><sup>[732]</sup></a> Nor were the
colonial measures of the other nations less repressive.<a id='r733'></a><a href='#f733' class='c014'><sup>[733]</sup></a> Both
religious and economic interests, therefore, made it desirable
that the English colonies should remain within the English
Empire; and it was the power of England alone which enabled
them to do so. For it was not a question, for example, of the
sturdy New England settlers warding off attacks from the far
fewer French inhabitants of Canada. No colony was self-supporting
or economically self-contained. Cut off from access to
the mother-country, deprived of her protection on the ocean
trade-routes, they would inevitably wither and die, or be absorbed
into one of the rival and less liberal empires.<a id='r734'></a><a href='#f734' class='c014'><sup>[734]</sup></a> The allegiance
of the colonists of various nations was in only slight
measure determined by their own comparative strengths, and
almost wholly by the naval powers of the home countries.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such, in brief outline, was the European theory of empire
held during our colonial period, some of the main features in
the practical application of which can be traced back for several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>centuries before ever the question of empire arose, as we
have indicated in our earlier chapters.<a id='r735'></a><a href='#f735' class='c014'><sup>[735]</sup></a> The old life of the
Middle Ages, which had been largely municipal, had become
national. The extraordinary energy of the new period, facing
an entire globe to be appropriated and exploited, rapidly developed
national spirit into imperial ambition, and the old
ideas and practices of a small and legally restricted commerce
had to be suddenly adapted and enlarged to meet a situation
unprecedented in history. The surprising fact is not that, in
so many ways, the theory and practice of empire-making should
have contained errors and worked injustices, but that one
which, after all, proved highly successful, should have been
developed so immediately and so surely.</p>

<p class='c001'>Until comparatively recently, the Mercantile Theory was
regarded as a sinister device to give play to the selfish profiteering
of the English merchant-class. It is, however, coming
more and more to be recognized as a necessary step in the
evolution of the modern state. “What was at stake,” writes
Schmoller, who was the leader in these newer views, “was the
creation of real <em>political</em> economies as unified organisms, the
centre of which should be, not merely a state policy reaching
out in all directions, but rather the living heart-beat of a
united sentiment. Only he who thus conceives of mercantilism
will understand it; in its innermost kernel it is nothing
but state-making, not state-making in a narrow sense, but
state-making and national-economy-making at the same time;
state-making in the modern sense, which creates out of the
political community an economic community, and so gives it
a heightened meaning. The essence of the system,” he adds,
“lies not in some doctrine of money, or of the balance of trade;
not in tariff barriers, protective duties, or navigation laws; but
in something far greater, namely, in the total transformation
of society and its organization, as well as of the state and its
institutions; in the replacing of a local and territorial economic
policy by that of the national state.”<a id='r736'></a><a href='#f736' class='c014'><sup>[736]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Modern critics of the theory have been prone to lay stress
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>upon the obvious defects and shortcomings which appear in
the workings of the enactments designed to translate it into
practice. As a matter of fact, the policy proved successful, in
spite of the eventual loss to England, a century later, of a
portion of her colonies; while in a different and higher form,
that of an imperial federated <span lang="de"><i>Zollverein</i></span>, it is still regarded by
many as the solution of the possibly insoluble problem of imperial
government.</p>

<p class='c001'>In a speech at the Savoy, in London, in 1917, the Premier of
Newfoundland, England's oldest colony, gave notable expression
to such a return to the policy of an earlier day. “This
Empire,” he said, “cannot live as a political empire unless it
is developed as an economic empire. All the raw material
produced in the Empire should be manufactured in the Empire
before it leaves the Empire, and nothing should be admitted
into the Empire that could be produced in the Empire.”<a id='r737'></a><a href='#f737' class='c014'><sup>[737]</sup></a> Let
us not condemn too hastily the economic theories of the seventeenth
century until we are quite sure whither those of the
twentieth are to lead us.</p>

<p class='c001'>The strength of an ocean empire lies wholly in sea-power,
and the roots of sea-power in the merchant marine. By her
application of the Mercantile Theory, England forced the
Dutch, who had “run hackney all the world over,” from the
carrying-trade of her colonies; and for all the centuries since,
she has been the great commercial nation of the world. France,
who abandoned Colbert's policy, and turned her back on the
sea in 1672, embarking upon a career of Continental conquest,
was, during the next century, to be beaten by England single-handed
for the first time since the Middle Ages, to have her
merchant shipping swept away, and to lose Martinique, Guadaloupe,
Canada, and India to her rival.<a id='r738'></a><a href='#f738' class='c014'><sup>[738]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It has too frequently been assumed to be an obvious conclusion
that the Navigation Acts of the seventeenth century
were a colossal blunder, because, in part, the commercial policy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>of England lost her the continental colonies in the eighteenth.
Those who would commit themselves to such a view might
well determine whether, had England not made use of the
weapons of the earlier century, and thus developed that naval
power which alone enabled her to protect her American possessions,
she would have had any colonies left, continental or
other, to be kept or lost by any policies which she might adopt
in the later period.</p>

<p class='c008'>Having glanced at the theory of empire as it was understood
by those at home, we must turn to consider the measures
adopted to reduce it to practice, and also the views of
imperial relations held by the colonists.</p>

<p class='c001'>We may again emphasize the fact that the colonies were
dependencies of England, and not independent nations. It
was as much the right and duty of England to assert and
maintain some sort of imperial control over them as it has
been of the United States to do the same over her own territorial
possessions. The colonists were Englishmen, settled
upon English lands, subject to English laws, entitled to the
rights of Englishmen at home, protected by English power.
The control exercised over them was not that of a foreign
nation, or imposed by conquest; and the mere fact that some
control should be exercised could not in itself be construed as
an act of oppression or tyranny. Had the waste lands on
which these emigrating Englishmen settled been contiguous
to the borders of any English county, none of the questions that
arose as to their relations to English sovereignty would have
arisen. They were all due to the distance, translated into
time, that separated these English subjects from the seat of authority,
and to the new conditions of their strange environment.
From those two elements, “arose all that was peculiar and
exceptional in their relations with the British government.”<a id='r739'></a><a href='#f739' class='c014'><sup>[739]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>At the time when the New England colonies were planted,
the doctrine of Parliamentary sovereignty, of the supreme
authority in the state of that body which had hitherto been
regarded rather as a judicial than a legislative one, was beginning
to take hold of men's minds. It required, however, the
ordeal by battle of a civil war to decide the question; and it
was not until the Restoration that Parliament took its permanent
place among English institutions.<a id='r740'></a><a href='#f740' class='c014'><sup>[740]</sup></a> The close connection
of the colonies with the Crown arose from the fact that,
during the period of their founding, their relations to the government
of England were mainly with the Executive and as
occupiers of the soil, the executive power being then lodged in
the King in Council, and the title to the land being vested
in the Crown.<a id='r741'></a><a href='#f741' class='c014'><sup>[741]</sup></a> As the constitutional situation gradually altered,
the colonies remained, of course, subject to the sovereign
power, wherever located, as did Englishmen at home,
although so complex, and difficult of both legal and equitable
settlement, were the questions of sovereignty in the Empire
raised by the phenomena of overseas dominions, that it is
highly questionable whether their solution has ever been found.
Only a few years ago, a brilliant Englishman could speak of
the bonds then uniting England and her colonies as “a confusion
of legal formulas and brittle sympathies”; and although,
as tested in the world-crisis of the Great War, those
sympathies have proved anything but brittle, his conclusion
that imperial sovereignty is, in reality, non-existent, seems
irrefutable.<a id='r742'></a><a href='#f742' class='c014'><sup>[742]</sup></a> The ship of state to-day, compared to that of
the seventeenth century, is as a dreadnought to the Mayflower;
but if, after three centuries, the problem of imperial
organization is yet awaiting solution, with the best of will on
the part of both England and the dominions, there need be
little surprise, and certainly no bitterness, over the slow and
blundering beginnings. Unfortunately, owing to the uncertainty,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>in the course of England's political evolution, as to
where sovereignty really lay, and also to the inherent difficulties
involved in the question of the realm and the dominions,
alluded to in an earlier chapter, the way was all too
open for controversial misunderstandings on purely technical
grounds between the colonies and the mother-country. And
this quite apart from the difficulties raised by distance, and the
attempted course of Stuart usurpation, against which latter,
it must be remembered, the forces of freedom were to struggle
in old England as well as in her colonies.</p>

<p class='c001'>During the period covered by this volume, control over the
colonies was asserted in various ways and at various times by
both Parliament and the Crown. Patentees of the royal
charters not infrequently asked Parliament to confirm their
privileges; while that body often inquired into the use which
was being made of those monopolistic documents; for it is
sometimes forgotten that such a charter as that obtained by
Massachusetts, for example, while regarded by the company
as the basis of its liberties, could also, quite as legitimately, be
regarded by the nation as creating a monopoly in one of its
worst forms—that of the exclusive use of the Crown, or public,
lands. For the most part, however, Parliament confined
itself to passing legislation regarding trade only, its control
over the customs being continuous from 1641.<a id='r743'></a><a href='#f743' class='c014'><sup>[743]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Those who intended to found plantations necessarily had to
apply to the king for a charter, in order to obtain possession
of the soil and exemption from certain laws covering emigration
and export. Technically, the charters of the corporate
colonies ranked merely with those of English municipal corporations.
According to a strict interpretation of the law,
therefore, so long as the private rights of individuals were not
infringed, the English government would be technically justified
in altering colonial institutions, or in dividing and combining
colonies, without the consent of the inhabitants.<a id='r744'></a><a href='#f744' class='c014'><sup>[744]</sup></a> As
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>is always the case, old laws and institutions were slightly altered
by the use of legal fictions and by modifications in practice,
to meet the needs of a new situation. It is unthinkable
that an entirely new body of law, and a wholly new set of institutions,
should have been created, to serve political contingencies
that could by no means have been foreseen.</p>

<p class='c001'>The element of distance again came into play, to alter profoundly
the practical effect of legal technicalities. In England
the sovereign power, in exercising its jurisdiction over municipalities,
had local knowledge of conditions, and could take immediate
and effective action. Moreover, even when the citizens
of the municipality were not represented in Parliament,
they were yet largely protected from acts of oppression by the
fact that such acts were prevented by the self-defensive foresight
of other municipalities, which were represented. The
situation in regard to the colonies was entirely different.
Owing to the distance which separated them from home, it
was impossible that either the king or Parliament could have
accurate knowledge of local conditions, or take prompt measures.
The difficulties as to both these points, in the unsettled
state of England in the earlier part of the seventeenth
century, were responsible for the extraordinary freedom which
the colonists enjoyed from interference in their domestic political
affairs. In addition, as their local conditions were little
understood, and of but slight moment to the bulk of Englishmen
at home, and as the interests of one colony frequently
conflicted with those of another differently situated, their
rights, in the absence of parliamentary representation, did not
possess even that vicarious protection enjoyed by their legal
equivalents, the unrepresented municipal corporations in
England. Of necessity, therefore, colonial interests, from the
standpoint of the colonists, were bound to be in part neglected
by England, and in part misunderstood, while they served, to
a far greater extent than was possible with those of any class
or body at home, as the hunting-ground of rival cliques of
self-interested individuals or groups.</p>

<p class='c001'>Down to 1643, when Parliament, as a result of the Civil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>War, assumed the position of executive head of the government,
colonial affairs had been in the hands of the King in
Council, and had been managed by a succession of committees,
sub-committees, and commissions, one of which we have
already encountered on the other side of the water at the time
of the troubles over the Massachusetts charter.<a id='r745'></a><a href='#f745' class='c014'><sup>[745]</sup></a> During the
period of the Interregnum, these were replaced by a tangle of
committees of Parliament and the Protector's Council, none
of which were continuous, or able to formulate and carry
through a consistent policy. We have already seen the results
of the administrative confusion, in the opportunity which
it gave the New England colonies, and of which they made
full use, to develop their local institutions and policy in almost
entire disregard of their position in the Empire.</p>

<p class='c001'>This almost complete absence of any steady policy or consistent
control over the component parts of the imperial
structure not only was unacceptable to the merchants at home,
but would probably have been destructive of the Empire had
it continued without change. Certain measures of far-reaching
importance, however, had already been enacted under
Cromwell; and the Restoration, which strengthened the government
and united the people, enabled England to undertake
a more comprehensive scheme for imperial organization,
although in New England, owing to the incorrigible tendencies
of the Stuarts, it blundered into criminal folly.</p>

<p class='c001'>At first, two councils were created, one for Trade, and the
other for Plantations, their instructions largely following
drafts prepared by the London merchants Povey and Noell,
who had for some years been actively engaged in the study of
colonial questions, and the formulation of a colonial policy.<a id='r746'></a><a href='#f746' class='c014'><sup>[746]</sup></a>
However these instructions might strike colonists who refused
to acknowledge any right of control whatever by the mother-country,
they could not but appear wise and just to the statesmen
and citizens at home. The councillors were ordered, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>the first place, to make a complete survey—by means of correspondence
with the colonial governors—of the laws and
institutions, population and means of defense of each colony.
They were to study “means for the rendering those dominions
usefull to England, and England helpful to them, and for the
bringing the several Colonies and Plantations, within themselves,
into a more certain civill and uniforme waie of government
and for the better ordering and distributing of publique
justice among them.” They were, further, to maintain a correspondence
with the local authorities in the several colonies,
so that they might have constant knowledge of “their complaints,
their wants, their abundance,” and their shipping, the
latter for revision of the Navigation Laws. Finally, they were
to study the methods employed by other states in their colonial
government, and to call experts to their assistance in any
particular when needed.<a id='r747'></a><a href='#f747' class='c014'><sup>[747]</sup></a> The Council was made up of able
men, almost all of them authorities on colonial questions,
and in close touch with the colonies, while the business, in the
first instance, was frequently entrusted to experts.<a id='r748'></a><a href='#f748' class='c014'><sup>[748]</sup></a> Of the
work of the Council, Professor Andrews writes, that “there
was not an important phase of colonial life and government,
not a colonial claim or dispute, that was not considered carefully,
thoroughly, and in the main, impartially.”<a id='r749'></a><a href='#f749' class='c014'><sup>[749]</sup></a> In fact, an
unbiased study of the actions taken by the Privy Council and
its committees during nearly the whole of the seventeenth
century leads one to agree with the editor of the Acts, that,
as a governing body, it was “anxious to help, willing to take
advice, free from preconception.”<a id='r750'></a><a href='#f750' class='c014'><sup>[750]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The only individual connecting link between New England
and the government in England was the unofficial “agent”
whom one or another of the colonies appointed at times of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>crisis, such as the Hocking murder or the Dr. Child petition,
to present their case to the authorities. Although unofficial,
the office was recognized by the English government, and
such agents were employed by most of the colonies, island as
well as continental, the office becoming an integral part of the
administrative machinery of the following century.<a id='r751'></a><a href='#f751' class='c014'><sup>[751]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Such, in bare outline, were the organs employed by England
in the administration of the colonies. Of the legislative enactments
designed to build up the Empire, the most important
were precursors of the more famous Navigation Acts of the
following century. In 1650, 1651, 1660, and 1663, ordinances
were passed for the control of trade and shipping, which, in
the period now under review, were more important in their
political than in their economic influence upon New England.
Holland had been the first of the European nations to understand
the effect upon economic prosperity at home of the
building up of colonial trade, and in the middle of the seventeenth
century threatened to absorb the entire carrying trade
of the world, the value of goods shipped annually in Dutch
bottoms having been estimated at a billion francs.<a id='r752'></a><a href='#f752' class='c014'><sup>[752]</sup></a> The English
Navigation Acts of Cromwell and Charles II, like the
policy initiated by Colbert in France, were aimed mainly at
breaking the monopoly of Holland, and building up the national
merchant-marines of England and France. Even the
fisheries off the coasts of England and Scotland had passed
into Dutch hands, and Englishmen had long been clamoring
for some means of fighting commercially the growing menace
of Dutch sea power.<a id='r753'></a><a href='#f753' class='c014'><sup>[753]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>As the effects upon New England, until the following century,
were mainly indirect, it is not necessary to give the
details of the various acts in the order in which they were
passed. Their aim was twofold—destructive and constructive.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>In the former aspect, they aimed at diminishing, if not wholly
destroying, the shipping, and so both the commerce and the
naval power of competing states. On their constructive side,
their design was to build up the shipping of the English Empire,
and, in reference to certain articles, to make England the
sole market for their trade. As to the first point, the colonies
were put upon the same basis as England herself; and, in
exchange for the advantages derived by her from the second,
she offered the colonists certain privileges in the home markets.
It was, therefore, enacted that no trade could be carried on between
England and her dominions except in ships owned by her
or them, and manned by English or colonial crews, the same
restriction applying to all goods imported into either from any
foreign country or colony in America, Asia, and Africa.<a id='r754'></a><a href='#f754' class='c014'><sup>[754]</sup></a> This
was merely an extension of acts already frequently passed, or
provisions in the early charters, such as we have already noted.</p>

<p class='c001'>The other main point, that of limiting the markets in certain
goods to England, was also merely an extension of another
long-familiar idea. When the economic organization, in the
later Middle Ages, was still largely municipal, it had been
found advantageous to designate certain towns as the sole
markets, or “staple,” for certain goods. For some centuries,
the belief in the economic soundness of this practice continued
to be held; and, as we noted in the very first charter relating
to America,—that of Cabot, in 1496,—it was required that
all goods should pass through the port of Bristol. The Navigation
Act of Charles II required that certain “enumerated”
commodities produced in the colonies should be sold only in
England, and not directly to foreigners, thus making England
the “staple” for the Empire in the same way in which certain
municipalities had formerly been the staples for the kingdom.
Theoretically, the colonists were in the same relative position
to England in the matter as were Englishmen at home to the
staple municipalities, although, of course, the practical disadvantages
and injustice to the colonists were much greater
when the scheme was made imperial.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>The list of enumerated commodities in the seventeenth
century, however, was very limited, and no such restrictions
were placed upon purely intercolonial commerce. A number
of the most important colonial exports, such as wheat and
fish, were not included; while of the more important ones
named, none were produced in New England, and but one—tobacco—by
any of the American continental colonies. As
an offset to the advantages accruing to England by thus controlling
the sale of the enumerated commodities, that country
placed prohibitive duties on many of them when imported
from other countries, thus giving the colonies the monopoly
of the market to which they were limited. In the case of
tobacco, which was successfully grown in England, she incurred
the resentment of a considerable element in her own
agricultural classes by forbidding its culture. So great, indeed,
was the opposition to giving the American planters the monopoly
of the English market, that the government had for
many years to use armed forces against its own citizens to
keep faith with the colonies.<a id='r755'></a><a href='#f755' class='c014'><sup>[755]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The only other point of importance in these early acts was
the provision in that of 1663, that no European manufactured
goods could be shipped to the colonies unless first landed in
England, Wales, or Berwick. Owing, however, to a system of
drawbacks on the duties paid in these cases, such goods frequently
sold in the colonies at lower prices than they could
be sold for in England itself; and certain exceptions, such as
Portuguese wines, and salt for the fisheries, were of especial
benefit to New England. Indeed, it is noteworthy that the
New England colonies, although the least desirable part of
the Empire from the English standpoint, and constantly giving
trouble politically, were nevertheless accorded particularly
considerate treatment from time to time, within the limits
of the imperial system. Under the Commonwealth, in 1644,
they had been exempted from the payment of all English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>import and export duties, which naturally gave them a great
advantage over the other colonies, and made them the envy
of the Empire.<a id='r756'></a><a href='#f756' class='c014'><sup>[756]</sup></a> A dozen years later, by an act of Parliament,
foreign ships were allowed to carry fish from both the Newfoundland
and New England fisheries, nullifying to that extent
the Act of 1650; and, after the Restoration, their trade was
specifically exempted from certain onerous clauses in the Navigation
Acts, as then interpreted, although that of the other
colonies was not.<a id='r757'></a><a href='#f757' class='c014'><sup>[757]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>As to the success of the above acts, there can now be little
question, and their former condemnation on economic grounds
has given place to the recognition of the fact that they did
indeed secure the objects intended, and that the welfare of
the Empire as a whole, as well as that of England herself, was
promoted by them. The merchant marine was doubled in
eighteen years, the Dutch and other competitors beaten off,
and the Empire, and notably New England, greatly increased
in power and wealth.</p>

<p class='c001'>As we have already indicated, however, European imperial
theory in the seventeenth century had one serious defect. It
failed to take account of human nature in the colonist. Like
so many modern theories which consider the state as all, and
the individual as nothing, it made the blunder of treating the
abstraction as human, and the human as an abstraction. It
asked too much of the individual, and, entirely apart from
selfish motives, which were found in the colonies quite as
much as in the mother-country, it almost of necessity subordinated
the interests of the former to those of the latter. The
success of the Empire as a whole was doubtless far more dependent
upon the strength and prosperity of England than
upon the fortunes of any individual colony; but that was a
point of view more likely to be appreciated by the contemporary
citizens at home, and the historians of a later day,
than by the contemporary colonist, who saw his particular
interests made to suffer for those of the Empire, and his local
pride constantly wounded by a sense of subordination to a power
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>three thousand miles away. For in all the difficulties between
England and her colonies, we continually have to come back
to the element of distance. What made the acts of the government
seem autocratic was not the fact that the colonists were
not directly represented in Parliament,—for neither were a
large number of Englishmen at home,—but that, by virtue
of the effects of distance, the central government was external
to the colonists, in a sense in which it never was to the unrepresented
Englishmen in England itself. It is difficult to see how
any system of representation could have been devised which
would have improved the position of the colonies, although
representation in the English Parliament was proposed by
Barbadoes as early as 1652.<a id='r758'></a><a href='#f758' class='c014'><sup>[758]</sup></a> There was, in fact, no original
thought contributed by any of the colonies, which was of
practical use in devising any better scheme of imperial control
than that which England was gradually evolving. During
the formative period, the colonies offered nothing of a constructive
character to the solution of the problem, and contented
themselves with a purely obstructionist attitude of
attempting to ignore or oppose any measure which they deemed
in conflict with their local interests.</p>

<p class='c001'>At more than one period, English colonists have been accused
of believing that “it is the undoubted right of every Englishman
to settle where he likes, to behave as he sees fit, and to
call upon the Mother-Country to foot the bill.”<a id='r759'></a><a href='#f759' class='c014'><sup>[759]</sup></a> This,
however, is not merely a colonial characteristic: it is the spirit
developed upon every frontier, as the later history of American
westward expansion may be called upon to illustrate; and,
as we have pointed out, the whole chain of colonies formed
the long encircling frontier of England. The spirit of stubborn
resistance to any interference with their legal rights, or
even with their mere freedom of action, was quite as often
found in the island-colonies of both France and England as
it was in the continental ones now included in the United
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>States. The residents of Barbadoes, for example, in a memorial
condemning the Navigation Act of 1651, used language which
has a ring that has often been considered peculiarly American.
After denying that Parliament had any jurisdiction over them,
because they were unrepresented, the settlers went on to say
that, if they could not obtain a peaceful settlement of the dispute,
yet “wee will not alienate ourselves from those old
heroick virtues of true Englishmen to prostitute our freedom
and privileges to which we are borne to the will and opinion
of any one; neither do wee think our number so contemptible,
nor our resolution so weake as to be forced or perswaded to so
ignoble a submission, and we cannot think that there are any
amongst us who are soe simple and soe unworthily minded,
that they would not rather chuse a noble death than forsake
their ould liberties and privileges.”<a id='r760'></a><a href='#f760' class='c014'><sup>[760]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In spite of the nobility of the sentiment, however, the
position assumed, as was frequently the case in Massachusetts,
was in fact unwarranted from a strictly legal point of view.
Had the stand taken by England on important points in the
long colonial controversy been indeed illegal, the problem
would have been enormously simplified. As a matter of fact,
it was rather the contentions of the colonists which were,
from the strict technical standpoint, the illegal ones.<a id='r761'></a><a href='#f761' class='c014'><sup>[761]</sup></a> But the
real questions were not questions of law, although, with the
instincts of their race, the Englishmen on both sides of the
water fought them out as if they were. One might as well
have passed laws to forbid a boy outgrowing his clothes, as
to forbid rapidly developing and far-separated colonies from
outgrowing the doctrine of a centralized imperial sovereignty.
This fact, which is now wholly admitted by the most patriotic
Englishmen, both at home and in the dominions, was unfortunately
beyond the ken of seventeenth-century thought.</p>

<p class='c001'>The attitude of the most powerful colony in New England
had been foreshadowed from the very beginning. The transfer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>of the Massachusetts charter to the colony itself had obviously
been for the purpose of escaping as far as possible from the
jurisdiction of the English courts, and establishing a virtually
independent government, under a strained construction of
that document. We have already seen how the colony had
arrogated to itself sovereign powers, how it had over and over
refused appeals to the home courts and Crown, how it had
erected fortifications, and taken other military measures to
resist by force the assertion of her authority by England, and
how it had made treaties of both war and peace with foreign
powers. In 1652, it established a mint, the coins having the
famous device of the pine tree and the word “Massachusetts”
on one side, and “New England” and the date on the other,
but with no recognition of the king.<a id='r762'></a><a href='#f762' class='c014'><sup>[762]</sup></a> Even the mere oath
of allegiance was refused whenever possible, although required
by the charter itself.<a id='r763'></a><a href='#f763' class='c014'><sup>[763]</sup></a> All of these acts represented a consistent
policy, openly avowed among themselves by the leaders, of
disputing any claims of the home country to any authority
whatsoever over the colony.</p>

<p class='c001'>From time to time, crises in its affairs brought out official
declarations of its attitude. Owing to the exigencies of the
Civil War in England, Parliament had issued commissions to
certain officers of the merchant marine, authorizing them to
make prizes of any vessels which they might find in the royal
service. In the summer of 1644, one of these officers, a Captain
Stagg, appeared in an armed ship in Boston harbor, and
there made prize of a Bristol ship, according to his orders. A
tumult was raised, and many of the magistrates and clergy, asserting
that “the people's liberties” had been violated, were in
favor of forcing the release of the seized vessel. A majority,
however, decided that the Parliament's commission must be
recognized; for, if its authority were denied in this, then the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>foundation of the colony's patent also would be denied, and if
they relied solely upon their Indian purchases to give them
title to the country, they would have to renounce “England's
protection, which were a great weakness in us, seing their care
hath been to strengthen our liberties and not overthrow them”;
and, also, if they should by opposing the Parliament “cause
them to forsake us, we could have no protection or countenance
from any, but should lie open as a prey to all men.” The way
for resistance at any time, however, was left open by declaring
that, by the course of affairs in England, the Parliament had
taught that “<span lang="la"><i>salus populi</i></span> is <span lang="la"><i>suprema lex</i></span>” and that, in case
that body should ever prove of a “malignant spirit,” “we may
make use of <span lang="la"><i>salus populi</i></span> to withstand any authority from thence
to our hurt.” During the discussion, some had maintained
that by their patent the colony was subject “to no other power
but among ourselves”; but that was denied.<a id='r764'></a><a href='#f764' class='c014'><sup>[764]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Two years later, however, in connection with the Dr. Child
petition, and the order of the English Commissioners concerning
Samuel Gorton, the local aspects of which have been
discussed in a previous chapter, the General Court undertook
to define the colony's relations to England more definitely.
While there was some difference of opinion, the majority of
the magistrates and of the clergy consulted took the stand that
by the charter they had “absolute power of government,”
with authority to “make laws, to erect all sorts of magistracy,
to correct, punish, pardon, govern, and rule the people absolutely,”
without the interposition of any superior power.
They denied that any appeal lay against any of their proceedings,
or that they were bound, “further than in a way of justification,”
to make answer to any complaints against them
in England. They drew a distinction between corporations
within England and those without, asserted that plantations
were above the rank of ordinary corporations, and added that
“our allegiance binds us not to the laws of England any longer
than while we live in England, for the laws of the parliament
of England reach no further, nor do the King's writs under the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>great seal.” They did, indeed, acknowledge some sort of
shadowy and undefined allegiance, and claimed protection
by the mother-country as a right.<a id='r765'></a><a href='#f765' class='c014'><sup>[765]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This theory of virtual independence was reasserted by the
Court in the year following the Restoration, with the addition
that they conceived that “any imposition prejudicial to the
country, contrary to any just law” not repugnant to the laws
of England, was an infringement of their rights, and that the
colony was privileged to defend itself, even by force of arms,
against any who should attempt its “destruction, invasion, detriment
or annoyance.”<a id='r766'></a><a href='#f766' class='c014'><sup>[766]</sup></a> The duties of allegiance were defined
somewhat more exactly than they had been fifteen years earlier,
and somewhat differently; but any sovereign rights of the
English government over its dependencies in the Empire were
denied.<a id='r767'></a><a href='#f767' class='c014'><sup>[767]</sup></a> More and more, not merely in theory, but in the
form that the colony's negotiations took with the home authorities
through its agents, it was endeavoring to assume the position,
not of an integral part of an empire, but of an allied
sovereign power.</p>

<p class='c001'>The attitude of Massachusetts has been noted because her
position was far more pronouncedly anti-English than was
that of her sister colonies in the group. Not only were the
governments of Plymouth, Rhode Island, and Connecticut
more democratic than that of Massachusetts, but the individual
citizens of those plantations were quite as tenacious of their
individual rights. Nevertheless, there was a much less aggressive
tone in their relations with the mother-country, and a
greater readiness to acknowledge imperial obligations in return
for imperial benefits. As we have seen, however, the frontier-spirit
was at work throughout the entire range of empire; and,
while probably, neither at that time, nor at any period down
to the formation of the union, was the anti-English element
in Massachusetts as large as used to be thought, nevertheless
it was the radical, and not the loyal and conservative element,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>which mainly determined her policy, and, gradually, that
of New England.</p>

<p class='c001'>If we wish to apportion fairly the praise and blame due to
individuals and peoples in history,—if indeed it is ever possible
to do so,—we must endeavor to look at their actions from
a purely contemporary point of view, and to ignore long-subsequent
results. The modern historian has come to realize
that the qualities of a people, the characteristics of an epoch,
the motives of a great struggle or movement, are by no means
the clear-cut, sharply defined matters sketched by the patriotic
writers of a simpler day. In the enormously complicated
development of modern society from the struggle of class with
class, the conflict of interest with interest, the clash of one
element against another, it is recognized that the contest was
at no time between clearly aligned forces of the powers of
darkness and the powers of light. “It is beginning to be seen,”
writes Professor McIlwain, speaking of the early constitutional
struggle at the time of de Montfort, “that men in the
past have really advanced the cause of liberty, though often
entirely unconscious of any such intention, or even when their
aims were entirely selfish.”<a id='r768'></a><a href='#f768' class='c014'><sup>[768]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The resistance to England by her colonies in the past, on
many occasions and from many quarters, has undoubtedly
advanced the cause of liberty throughout the entire Anglo-Saxon
race. The statesmen of England in the seventeenth
century, however, were confronted, as statesmen usually are, by
a practical problem, to be solved in the light of contemporary
knowledge, practices, and beliefs. As we have already noted,
neither Massachusetts, Barbadoes, Bermuda, nor any other of
the colonies engaged in defying and obstructing the attempts
of England to unify and govern the Empire, had any practicable
suggestion to offer. They could not be allowed by
England to become independent without running the risk of
their being absorbed by her rivals, France or Spain. Nor
did the colonies themselves wish to lose her protection. Much
as they might talk of armed resistance, the wisest men in them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>knew that they could not subsist alone, and preferred the rule
of England to that of any of the other empires. The letter
from Pynchon, quoted in an earlier chapter, the words of
Winthrop cited above, as well as other contemporary evidence,
show that the colonists realized and counted upon the power
of England to shield them, so that they should not, as Winthrop
said, “lie open as a prey to all men.”</p>

<p class='c001'>If England is to be condemned for interpreting the law,
which was indubitably on her side, in too narrow a spirit, and
of caring too much for her own interests in building up those
of the Empire, on the other hand it is difficult to acquit the
colonies of a selfishness almost as great, in their attempts to
secure all the advantages of empire, without being hampered
by its restrictions. They insisted, for example, upon protection
as a right, at the very time that they were flouting the
Navigation laws designed to foster that naval strength upon
which alone such protection could be based.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although the thought of England was constructive in reference
to the Empire, and that of the colonies was destructive,
nevertheless contemporary imperialism was destined to be influenced
quite as much by colonial fact as by English theory.
There was much in the imperial scheme that the colonist, from
his isolated position and limited outlook, failed to see, just as
there was much which, because of its conflict with his individual
interest, he refused to accept. But the facts that failed to
fit into the theory were far more obvious to him than to the
Englishman at home. The slower movement of the historical
process in the old world made it more difficult for the Englishman
at the centre of empire to foresee its future; while, owing
to the swifter course of evolution on the periphery of the system,
and the simplifications of the frontier, the colonist was
to a great extent already living in that future without thinking
about it at all.</p>

<p class='c001'>His interests, however, soon became wholly colonial and
extremely provincial, and his political thought became entirely
centred upon his local government, the development of which
grew more and more absorbing in proportion as its political dependence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>was diminished. But the real problem of the day was
not a domestic one for the several colonies, profound as were
the results to ensue from the development of the local New
England political institutions. The real problem was, how to
bring these local institutions into working relations with the
still necessary sovereign power at the centre of the system.
The colonists might offer legal objections or armed resistance,
in the way of criticism, but so long as they offered no help
in devising a workable solution of the problem, the obligation
to do so devolved upon England alone. The rapid material
success of the colonists, their new surroundings, their isolation,
their necessary self-reliance, and their new local pride,
were all developing, not, indeed, new thought, but new feeling.
Although the empire evolved from the Mercantile Theory
was a necessary step in the evolution of the empire of to-day,
the Englishman's thought and the colonists' feelings were bound
to clash over it, for the differences went far deeper than mere
economic interests. The problem of composing those differences,
great as it may have seemed to the contemporary
rulers in Europe, or to the protesting settler on every frontier,
were in reality far greater, even, than either of them dreamed.
Moreover, difficult as the question would have been in any
case, it had been rendered far more so by the disorganization
of authority at home in the constitutional struggle. With
the return of settled conditions at the Restoration of the monarchy
in England, it seemed as if a serious attempt were at last
to be made to bring order out of the increasing chaos of the imperial
situation. Unfortunately, the combined weakness and
tyranny of the restored Stuarts served to postpone, until after
that dynasty's second dethronement, the success of any efforts
to evolve and apply a considered and consistent colonial
policy.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XIII <br> <br>THE REASSERTION OF IMPERIAL CONTROL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The Puritan Revolution in England had failed to establish
a permanent government, which should provide for the liberty
of the individual, and be consonant with the genius of the
English race. The ensuing restoration of the monarchy was
not the return of a king crushing rebellion by force of arms. It
was the peaceful reëstablishment of an institution demanded
by large and important elements among the people, who considered
it as essential to the welfare of the state, and who
believed that the individuals who might occupy the throne
had been taught sufficiently by the events of the preceding
two decades not to attempt to overstep the position that had
come to be assigned to them in the popular view of the
constitution. But if, in the sphere of practical politics, the
Revolution had merely shattered the political edifice without
having been able to build another, in the domain of political
thought it had left a rich legacy of ideas, which were to mould
into modern form the institutions now reëstablished by the
will of the people. We have already seen how quickly the
anti-English party in Massachusetts had seized upon one of
the most revolutionary of the Commonwealth doctrines, and
proclaimed for themselves, as taught by Parliament, that
“<span lang="la"><i>salus populi</i></span> is <span lang="la"><i>suprema lex</i></span>.” These ideas, however, were
not to bear their full fruit until detached from their theological
origin and divested of their religious associations. This
secularization of politics, by the substitution of parties for
churches as political forces, was necessary before further
advances could be made either in religious toleration or in
civil liberty; and it was in the years following the Restoration
that the transition occurred both in old England and in New.<a id='r769'></a><a href='#f769' class='c014'><sup>[769]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>In the latter, and more particularly in Massachusetts,
theology and politics had been more closely intertwined than
anywhere else in the Empire, and the earlier course of the
struggle to break them asunder has been indicated in the preceding
chapters. As we have there pointed out, the fundamental
idea of theocracy was such as to preclude the possibility
of either civil or religious freedom. The latter was too evidently
fatal to the maintenance of that peculiar form of government
to be allowed, if it could possibly be suppressed; and
the former could not exist in a state in which the entire political
power was to be permanently wielded by a small minority,
whose essential qualification was its assent to an unique form
of ecclesiastical organization. To what lengths the theocratical
party in Massachusetts were willing to go in their efforts to
remain in power had been shown by their contest with the
Quakers. Although they were defeated in that struggle, amid
many evidences that religion and politics were becoming more
and more distinct in the minds of the people, the struggle was
by no means ended, nor the transition complete. The political
contest with the mother-country, which was now to begin
in earnest, and which has often been made to seem a struggle
for liberty against tyranny, was in large part, in this early
stage, merely a continuance, under another guise, of the attempt
of the theocracy to maintain its position and to defy all efforts,
either from within or without, to interfere with its unrestricted
exercise of power.</p>

<p class='c001'>The early years of the Restoration mark, in many respects,
the beginning of the modern period of English history; and
this is as true of the Empire as a whole as of the constitutional
developments at home. The far-seeing colonial policy of
Clarendon sought to take advantage of the new outburst of
energy which marked the people at that time, in order to round
out and consolidate the nation's colonial possessions; and the
main aspects of imperial policy became military and commercial.
The Act of Uniformity, passed in 1662, and aimed
at the Puritans, did not include the colonies in its operation;
and the course of events proved that the influence of the home
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>authorities was thenceforth to be on the side of toleration in
so far as America was concerned.</p>

<p class='c001'>When Clarendon entered office, the colonial dependencies
of England in the New World consisted in general of two
isolated groups of settlements on the continent, with island
outposts at the extreme north and south. A study of a map
of the period reveals the essential weakness of the English
position from the standpoint both of trade and of imperial defence.
The two most important colonial events in Clarendon's
ministry—the great extension of English continental
territory to the south by the settlement of the Carolinas, and
the acquisition of New Netherland—added enormously to
the strength and unity of the Empire. By the elimination
of the Dutch, Clarendon argued that not only would the
northern and southern colonies be relieved of the presence of
a hostile state lying between them, but the menace of a flank
or rear attack by the French would be largely removed from
New England by securing the important military advantages
of the Hudson-Mohawk route, the Lake Champlain gateway,
and the friendship of the Iroquois. Moreover, so long as
Holland, which was England's most serious rival in the world's
carrying trade, should remain in possession of New York,
New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware, it would obviously
be almost impossible to enforce the Navigation Acts, upon
the observance of which, it was rightly believed at that stage,
that the Empire's commercial success and power of defense
almost wholly depended.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this last respect, however, New England, although settled
ostensibly by loyal Englishmen, was almost as much of a danger
as was New Netherland, settled by the Empire's rivals.
New England's foreign commerce, which had amounted to
very little before the English Civil War, had grown rapidly
with the prosperity of the West-Indian sugar colonies, and by
the time of the Restoration had assumed considerable proportions,
both with the other colonies and with foreign countries.
But New England merchants paid almost no attention to the
laws of trade.<a id='r770'></a><a href='#f770' class='c014'><sup>[770]</sup></a> In 1665, Captain Leverett, who had seized a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>Dutch vessel from Amsterdam trading at Boston, was strongly
censured by the Massachusetts General Court, which announced
that such seizures under the Navigation Acts would
not be permitted “without the consent or allowance of authoritie
heere established”; and the officer escaped severer
punishment only by apologies and by solemnly protesting his
fidelity to the local administration.<a id='r771'></a><a href='#f771' class='c014'><sup>[771]</sup></a> Two years later, and
again in 1658, Rhode Island officially proclaimed free trade with
the Dutch; and in 1660, Connecticut, through her governor,
denied that she had any laws not permitting it.<a id='r772'></a><a href='#f772' class='c014'><sup>[772]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>New England's flouting of imperial authority, and more
particularly, the pretensions of Massachusetts to what was
virtually an independent sovereignty, were becoming notorious
throughout the Empire and in foreign countries. If England
should suffer herself to be defied with impunity by her own
subjects, the decline in her prestige could hardly fail to result
in the disintegration of the Empire, both from internal revolts
and from external aggression. It may be pointed out that such
a result, although serious for England, would have been fatal
to the colonies, which would have played the part of Red Riding
Hood to the French wolf.</p>

<p class='c001'>The colonial policy of Clarendon was probably influenced,
in the main, by the above considerations in respect to North
America. But, when the new government came into power
at the Restoration, there were other reasons why its attention
should immediately be turned to New England. We have
already noted how the trampling upon private rights by
Massachusetts in her aggressive policy of annexation, the
dissatisfaction with her government on the part of many of
her own citizens, the persecution endured by the Quakers, and
the various disputes between the colonies over boundaries
and other matters, had occasioned complaints, increasing in
number and seriousness. Owing mainly to the extraordinary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>ability and persistence which the Bay Colony had shown in
the “gentle art of making enemies” for the past thirty years,
all of the above matters, and others, in their worst possible
light, were promptly brought to the attention of the restored
King and Council. Throughout the years 1660 and 1661,
the ghosts of old wrongs done by Massachusetts seem constantly
to have haunted the meetings of the Council, to plead
their cause against that colony. The appeals of the Quakers,
and the effective but temporary succor afforded them, have
already been noted in an earlier chapter. Edward Godfrey,
who had been forced out of his government in Maine by the
Massachusetts Commissioners, filed long reports of his grievances
and of “the usurpations of the Bostoners.”<a id='r773'></a><a href='#f773' class='c014'><sup>[773]</sup></a> Robert
Mason protested against the annexation of New Hampshire,
and disregard of his rights there, as did Ferdinando Gorges,
grandson of old Sir Ferdinando, in reference to his Province
of Maine.<a id='r774'></a><a href='#f774' class='c014'><sup>[774]</sup></a> Captain Breedon gave a description of the political
conditions in Massachusetts, emphasizing the distinction between
freemen and non-freemen, the pretensions of sovereignty,
and the refusal to use the oath of allegiance, and called
attention to the shelter then being given to Whalley and
Goffe, two of the regicide judges, who had been received with
open friendliness by the colonial authorities.<a id='r775'></a><a href='#f775' class='c014'><sup>[775]</sup></a> A group of
English merchants, who had invested £15,000—the equivalent
of, perhaps, $300,000 to-day—in iron-works at Lynn,
claimed that, for alleged debts, their agents had been arrested,
their property seized, and that they were unable to gain satisfaction
in the colonial courts.<a id='r776'></a><a href='#f776' class='c014'><sup>[776]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>A number of other petitions were, with one exception, directed
against Massachusetts, and complained mainly of the illegality
or disloyalty of that colony's actions. Giles Sylvester, of
Shelter Island, in the exception noted, asserted that New
Haven had wrongfully confiscated three thousand acres of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>land, because he would not acknowledge himself to be under
its government.<a id='r777'></a><a href='#f777' class='c014'><sup>[777]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Of more interest, however, than these petitions for the
righting of individual wrongs, were the information and advice
given by Samuel Maverick, who happened to be in England
at the return of Charles. Maverick, as we have seen, had
been living in Massachusetts some years before John Endicott
or John Winthrop had thought of going there. For nearly
forty years, since 1624, he had watched its development, and,
as he possessed considerable ability and a fairly sound judgment,
in addition to his almost unique personal knowledge of
the colony's history, his opinion would naturally carry weight
with the English authorities. He had steadily opposed the
political and religious policy of the Massachusetts leaders,
and had been one of the signers of the Child petition in 1646.
In the letters which, for some years following 1660, he frequently
wrote to Lord Clarendon, his complaints of the past
occupy a minor position, and his plans for the reorganization
of the colonies evidently either coincided with those of the
minister or largely helped to form them.</p>

<p class='c001'>His suggestions embraced the elimination of the Dutch
danger by the taking of New Netherland, for which he rightly
thought that a small force would suffice. In view of the religious
intolerance, the political disabilities, the pronounced
disloyalty, the encroachments and boundary disputes, in evidence
in New England, he also advised the strengthening of
the royal control. He suggested that the oath of allegiance be
insisted upon; that the colonial laws be revised so as to agree
as nearly as possible with those of England; that writs be issued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>in the king's name; that liberty of conscience be allowed;
that the franchise be given to all freeholders, and the bounds
of every patent accurately determined.<a id='r778'></a><a href='#f778' class='c014'><sup>[778]</sup></a> As he estimated that
three fourths of the people were loyal, and that the greater
part of the Massachusetts non-freemen would favor the plan,
he looked for no resistance; and although he suggested sending
out a commission, he thought that no force would be necessary
except for the capture of New Netherland. He certainly
knew the colonies well, and, in part at least, may have been
right in his assumptions. Outside of the government clique in
Massachusetts there was undoubtedly a party of substantial
men who would have welcomed such a settlement of matters, and
the local authorities there were apparently doubtful as to how
far their course of opposition to England would be acquiesced
in by the country at large, should all the facts become known.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, if the years following the Restoration
marked the beginning of modern England, no less did they
embrace the actual beginning of American history. The first
settlers were in no real sense Americans. They were Englishmen,
with English associations, connections, and habits of
thought. Their natures were not altered fundamentally by
sailing to a land where the sun rose five hours later. The
remoteness of that land from the mother-country, and the
frontier conditions which prevailed in it did, indeed, change,
gradually but profoundly, the attitude of the settlers toward
many matters. But that took time, and it was only with
the rise of the second generation, which knew nothing of England
by personal experience; which had no close ties with
the home-land; whose minds and characters, for the worse
as well as for the better, were wholly the products of the
frontier, and whose interests and outlook were entirely provincial,
that an American, as distinct from an English, strain
may be said to appear in the history of our common race.
New England had been settled for approximately a generation
when the Restoration occurred, and there must have been,
by then, a considerable element of native-born colonials from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>twenty to thirty years old. If, however, the ties which bound
these younger citizens to England were looser, their education
was poorer, their religious feelings weaker, and their opposition
to the old theocratic policy stronger.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is impossible, from these conflicting factors, and with only
the evidence at hand, to say how nearly right was Maverick's
estimate of the people's loyalty; but he was certainly wrong
in believing that it would stand the test of taxes imposed from
above, or of blundering and tactless officials. He was right,
however, in urging that comprehensive reforms be undertaken
in colonial management, and that the case was urgent in that
it would become more difficult year by year. Something,
indeed, required to be done, for the good of the colonies as
well as of the Empire; and could it have been done wisely
and tactfully, this was undoubtedly the moment to have accomplished
it.</p>

<p class='c001'>All those interested in New England could not fail to recognize,
with varying emotions, that the situation had altered.
The possibility that England might at last be able to exercise
authority over her dependencies could bode nothing but evil
to the rulers of Massachusetts, in view of their record, theological
beliefs, and political aspirations. To the proprietors
of Maine and New Hampshire, on the other hand, it meant
the possibility of recovering their properties, which, in turn,
portended unsettlement and trouble for the inhabitants of
those provinces. For, although the course of Massachusetts
in annexing the eastern settlements had been overbearing,
illegal, and unscrupulous, the inhabitants were undoubtedly
better off than they would have been under absentee proprietors,
whose main interest would be in land-titles and taxes.
Connecticut and New Haven, which were not possessed of any
charters, and were exercising the powers of government without
any warrant, could not but be anxious for the future; and
Rhode Island, hoping, perhaps, for aid against her selfish and
aggressive neighbors, hastened to proclaim the King within
her borders.<a id='r779'></a><a href='#f779' class='c014'><sup>[779]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>In 1661, John Winthrop the younger, then, and for fifteen
years following, Governor of Connecticut,<a id='r780'></a><a href='#f780' class='c014'><sup>[780]</sup></a> was appointed as
agent to go to England, in order to present his colony's address
to the King and, if possible, to procure a charter.<a id='r781'></a><a href='#f781' class='c014'><sup>[781]</sup></a> He was
instructed to try to secure one as nearly like that of Massachusetts
as might be, though this seems to have been considered
improbable of attainment. He was also to have the bounds
extended southward to Delaware Bay, and eastward to Plymouth,
thus cynically ignoring the rights, legal or not, of
New Netherland, New Haven, and Rhode Island. This conscienceless
imperialism, which the colonists would have denounced
as tyranny and usurpation if indulged in by England,
was oddly balanced by New England conservatism in money
matters; for Connecticut's agent was instructed, in case he
should be unable to acquire all of the coast to Virginia, to content
himself with reaching the Hudson River, as the colony
did “not judge it requisite to expend money upon a Pattent.”<a id='r782'></a><a href='#f782' class='c014'><sup>[782]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>As a matter of fact, however, an expenditure was made of
about £500; and, possibly as a result of the judicious disposal
of this sum among the needy courtiers about the throne,
Winthrop secured a charter so liberal in its terms as to serve
as the constitution of colony and state until 1818.<a id='r783'></a><a href='#f783' class='c014'><sup>[783]</sup></a> It created
a corporation upon the place, provided for exactly the form of
government which the colonists already enjoyed, permitted
them to erect courts and make laws, and defined their bounds
as extending from “Narragansett river, commonly called Narragansett
Bay,” to the Pacific Ocean.<a id='r784'></a><a href='#f784' class='c014'><sup>[784]</sup></a> These new limits not
only included a large strip of Dutch territory and almost the
whole of Rhode Island, but wiped out New Haven entirely.</p>

<p class='c001'>The latter colony had made no effort to secure a patent
since 1645, when the agent dispatched for that purpose had
been drowned in the ill-fated and mysterious ship that had
carried down with it, not only the political hopes, but the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>financial fortunes, of the colonists.<a id='r785'></a><a href='#f785' class='c014'><sup>[785]</sup></a> There had been a growing
element in the colony, as in Massachusetts, which was
opposed to its theocratical government, and about the time
of the Restoration, this opposition was giving Davenport and
his followers much trouble. To the demand of sundry non-freemen
that the franchise be extended, the New Haven
Court had replied that they could not commit “weighty civill
or military trusts into the hands of either a crafty Achitophell
or a bloody Joab,” and that any one who should make
such suggestions would be considered “troublers of our peace
and disturbers of our Israell.” They asserted that to grant
a voice in the government to any but church members would
be to defeat the main end of the plantation, from “which we
cannot be perswaded to divert.”<a id='r786'></a><a href='#f786' class='c014'><sup>[786]</sup></a> This was exactly the stand
and reasoning persisted in by the Massachusetts leaders at
the same time. Both groups stood stubbornly with their
backs toward the future, and their eyes on Judea, attempting
to block the path to individual liberty with the whole strength
of civil power and religious prejudice. They as little understood
the new day which was dawning as did the restored
Stuarts in England; and the New England theocrats and the
English monarchs were at one in their resistance to the forces
of freedom.</p>

<p class='c001'>The disaffected element in New Haven, however, was
large and important; and when Connecticut's imperialistic
ambitions were gratified, and she obtained a charter which
gave her all her neighbor's territory, a very large proportion
of New Haven's inhabitants indicated that they preferred the
“Christless rule” of Connecticut, with its property qualification
for the franchise, to that of the New Haven churches.
Throughout the whole process of absorption of the smaller
colony by its now aggrandized neighbor, both the action and
the manner of Connecticut are difficult to defend. New
Haven, however, could not have stood alone much longer.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>Her commercial hopes had been proved without foundation;
she had unnecessarily, but seriously, offended the English
Crown; her theocratic government was inflexible; and her
annexation by the more democratic and progressive commonwealth
was wholly an advantage, then and later.<a id='r787'></a><a href='#f787' class='c014'><sup>[787]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In the ill-defined bounds of the Connecticut charter lay the
seeds of many a future contest; but the effect upon Rhode
Island was as immediate as upon New Haven. As we have
already seen, the Narragansett country had for some time
been a matter of controversy between the three adjoining
colonies. As Connecticut now extended to the Bay, by royal
grant, Massachusetts was seemingly excluded, and the contest
lay between Rhode Island's patent rights and those conferred
in her neighbor's new charter. John Clarke, in England at
the same time as Winthrop, immediately petitioned the King
for a new charter for Rhode Island.<a id='r788'></a><a href='#f788' class='c014'><sup>[788]</sup></a> This was granted, its
governmental provisions being virtually the same as those of
the Connecticut patent, except for the notable clause that, as
the Rhode Islanders were then holding forth the “livelie experiment
that a most flourishing civell state may stand and
best bee maintained ... with a full libertie in religious concernments,”
therefore no person in the colony should ever be
“molested, punished, disquieted, or called in question, for
any differences in opinione in matters of religion,” any law
enacted in England notwithstanding.<a id='r789'></a><a href='#f789' class='c014'><sup>[789]</sup></a> This patent, like the
Connecticut one, was so liberal, and so well drawn, that it
remained the constitution of colony and state for one hundred
and eighty years.<a id='r790'></a><a href='#f790' class='c014'><sup>[790]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>While the issue of the charter was pending, Clarke and Winthrop
had submitted the matter of the boundary between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>their two colonies to arbitration; and as a result, it had been
agreed between them that the dividing line should be the
Pawcatuck River, henceforth to be called the Narragansett.<a id='r791'></a><a href='#f791' class='c014'><sup>[791]</sup></a>
In the Rhode Island charter, therefore, that colony's western
boundary was made as agreed upon, the “clause in a late
grant” to Connecticut notwithstanding.<a id='r792'></a><a href='#f792' class='c014'><sup>[792]</sup></a> Connecticut, however,
which had now become even more reckless in its career
of land-grabbing than Massachusetts, repudiated its agent's
act, and undertook to enforce its claims to Rhode Island's
richest territory.<a id='r793'></a><a href='#f793' class='c014'><sup>[793]</sup></a> Not only was Connecticut's attitude selfish
and unjust, but the dispute could not fail to add another legitimate
reason for the exercise of imperial control by England.
As Sir Thomas Holdich points out, “It was the man with the
spade,—the agriculturist,—who first found the necessity for
definite boundaries”;<a id='r794'></a><a href='#f794' class='c014'><sup>[794]</sup></a> and while the fur trade or other activities
of rival colonizing nations, or of separate colonies of the
same nation, might give rise to disputes over frontiers, the
extreme frequency and bitterness of such quarrels in New
England were largely due to the type of political and economic
life developed there. Without question, their adjustment demanded
the intervention of the higher power of the home
country.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the time of Charles's return, Massachusetts was represented
in England by John Leverett, as her agent, who immediately
sent word of the complaints beginning to pour in
against the colony. As a result, the General Court dispatched
addresses both to the King and to Parliament, and appointed
Richard Saltonstall and Henry Ashurst to assist Leverett in
the controversy now imminent.<a id='r795'></a><a href='#f795' class='c014'><sup>[795]</sup></a> In the letter to Charles, the
Court prayed that monarch, now “King over your British
Israel, to cast a favorable eye upon your poore Mephibbosheth”;
and defended themselves against sundry charges, particularly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>those concerning the killing of the Quakers. “Such
was theire daingerous, impetuous and desperat turbulency,”
the writers affirmed, that the magistrates had perforce had
“to keepe the passage with the point of the sword held towards
them”; and the Court unblushingly added that, had the
Quakers not been restrained, “there was too much cause to
feare that wee ourselves must quickly have died.”<a id='r796'></a><a href='#f796' class='c014'><sup>[796]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In the private instructions to the colony's agents, they were
ordered to gain the interest of as many in Parliament and near
the King as possible, to secure the renewal of the charter, to
see that no superior power should be imposed, or appeals admitted,
and even, if possible, to have the colony free from
the English customs duties. If called upon to answer any
charges embarrassing to the colony, they were instructed to
plead lack of authority.<a id='r797'></a><a href='#f797' class='c014'><sup>[797]</sup></a> The agents seem, however, to have
done nothing in England to aid the colony; and Leverett's
remark that, if forced to admit appeals to the home country,
the colonists would deliver New England to the Spaniards,
although stupid enough, could hardly add to the government's
idea of the colonists' loyalty or discretion.<a id='r798'></a><a href='#f798' class='c014'><sup>[798]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Although the King's answer to the address was conciliatory,
the Massachusetts Court, upon its receipt, appointed a committee
to determine what, in its opinion, were the legal relations
between the colony and England. Their report, which
we have already discussed in the preceding chapter, considered
Massachusetts to be virtually an independent sovereign state,
with the right to defend itself by force of arms against any
“annoyance.”<a id='r799'></a><a href='#f799' class='c014'><sup>[799]</sup></a> The following spring, a thousand acres of
land were granted to the Artillery Company of Middlesex,
orders were issued for the better accommodation of the troopers
of Essex, and work was ordered rushed in order to complete
the fortifications on Castle Island.<a id='r800'></a><a href='#f800' class='c014'><sup>[800]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Meanwhile, “considering the weight of theire occasions in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>England,” the Court appointed Simon Bradstreet and the
Reverend John Norton to present a second address to the
King, and to “indeavor to take off all scandal and objections”
against the colony.<a id='r801'></a><a href='#f801' class='c014'><sup>[801]</sup></a> Although their work in England was
bitterly denounced as a failure, by some of the oligarchy,
they seem, in reality, to have done fairly well, and the letter
which the King next dispatched to the General Court was
mild in tone and required nothing that did not make for the
greater liberty of the individual colonist. After expressing
himself as well pleased with the colony's agents, the monarch
confirmed the charter, and granted pardon to all who had infringed
its terms in the past, as well as to any in the colony
who had committed offenses against him in the late Civil
War. Although he partially withdrew his protection from
the Quakers, he required that any person wishing to worship
according to the Book of Common Prayer be allowed to do so,
and that persons of good and honest lives be admitted to the
Communion, and their children to baptism. The franchise
was to be granted to all those of competent estate, orthodox
in religion, and not vicious in their lives. He also required
that the oath of allegiance be taken, and that justice be administered
in his name.<a id='r802'></a><a href='#f802' class='c014'><sup>[802]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The results of an increase in religious liberty were as much
dreaded by the leaders and their followers in the theocracy as
was any limitation placed by England upon those powers
which they had endeavored to make absolute. At a meeting
of the General Court in October, at which the letter was read,
the atrociously brutal law against the Quakers was immediately
put in force again, and the only compliances with the King's
requirements were the order that legal processes should run in
his name, and the issuing of directions that his letter be published.
Other action toward complying with its terms was
postponed until the next meeting of the Court. At that
meeting, seven months later, the letter was merely referred to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>a committee, which was to report again at the next meeting,
five months later still; at which, again, nothing was done. It
was the old policy, advised by the clergy nearly thirty years
earlier, of “avoid or protract,” of ignoring and obstructing.
However such a policy might fit an emergency under peculiar
conditions, it obviously could not form the basis of permanent
relations between organic parts of an empire.<a id='r803'></a><a href='#f803' class='c014'><sup>[803]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Trouble also arose for the colony from another direction.
It was impossible, in ordinary justice, that England should
ignore the complaints of the heirs of the original Gorges and
Mason regarding the illegal encroachments of Massachusetts
upon the lands claimed by them. Mason's petition was referred
to a committee of seven. Of these Mason was one,
although obviously the English government should not have
permitted him to be at once plaintiff and judge. But, aside
from irrelevant strictures upon the policy of Massachusetts,
the committee made a reasonable report, finding that Mason
had inherited a good title from his grandfather, and that for
many years Massachusetts had publicly recognized the line
three miles north of the Merrimac as her true boundary.<a id='r804'></a><a href='#f804' class='c014'><sup>[804]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Meanwhile, Gorges, who had petitioned the King in April,
1661, for possession of his province, did not wait for the process
of law, but appointed commissioners to go to Maine, proclaim
the King, collect the quit-rents, and establish a government,
notifying Massachusetts of their actions.<a id='r805'></a><a href='#f805' class='c014'><sup>[805]</sup></a> That colony
promptly ordered that all the inhabitants should yield obedience
only to herself and sent commissioners into the province
with instructions to suppress any disobedience by the use of
force, as they should see fit.<a id='r806'></a><a href='#f806' class='c014'><sup>[806]</sup></a> Under this conflict of authorities,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>the affairs of Maine, the inhabitants of which province were
scattered and somewhat unruly, were bound to drift into anarchy.
Daniel Gookin, of Boston, wrote a conciliatory letter to
Gorges, explaining the conditions from the standpoint of the
good of the people; but, a year later, the King, upon a report
of the technical legal aspects of the case, and apparently taking
into consideration the losses of Gorges's royalist grandfather,
ordered the inhabitants to submit to Gorges, or to give reasons
to the contrary without delay.<a id='r807'></a><a href='#f807' class='c014'><sup>[807]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The conditions in New England, in 1663, thus clearly necessitated
the sending out of a Royal Commission. The legal disputes
between Massachusetts and the English heirs of Gorges
and Mason could not fairly be left to the decision of Massachusetts
courts. Nor was the question one of technical
legal title alone; for, as the committee reporting on the Mason
claims had themselves pointed out, “publique interest and
goverment” were “much intermixt and concerned with the
private interest of the peticioners.”<a id='r808'></a><a href='#f808' class='c014'><sup>[808]</sup></a> Moreover, for nearly
thirty years, not only had boundary disputes between all the
New England colonies been growing steadily more complicated
and serious, but the colonies had proved themselves incapable,
in practically every case, of settling them permanently and
amicably. The contests could evidently be determined, in
the absence of any superior power, only by the use of force
by the claimants; and with the consistent attitude of Massachusetts
and the now rapidly increasing aggressiveness of
Connecticut, peace was seriously imperiled, and the fate of
the smaller colonies practically sealed. Rhode Island, at once
the most loyal and the most devoted to liberty of thought and
action, was already in imminent danger of annihilation. In
the disputed Narragansett country, the Atherton Company
claimed rights which could not be justly adjudicated by any of
the three colonies pretending jurisdiction, and prayed the
King for intervention.<a id='r809'></a><a href='#f809' class='c014'><sup>[809]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>The accounts of practically every observer agreed as to the
disloyalty of Massachusetts and her assumption of sovereignty,
which were obviously confirmed by her official acts. In
addition, the attitude of all the colonies to the English leaders
during the Revolution, the neglect of all, except Rhode Island,
promptly to proclaim the King, their protection of the regicide
judges, and the refusal to observe the Navigation Acts, raised
suspicions against them all. There was, besides, the religious
discrimination by Massachusetts, depriving her citizens of
rights which they would otherwise have enjoyed as Englishmen,
and the cases of alleged injustice in colonial courts affecting
English citizens with property rights in the colonies. In
the absence of a royal governor, or any other means by which
the home government could secure first-hand information,
there was no course to follow except to appoint a Commission
to go out and secure it, if the exceedingly complicated situation
was to be handled intelligently. The government had
shown itself more than willing to treat with the colonies through
their agents; but Massachusetts purposely denied to them any
authority, so as to obstruct and delay any action—an outworn
policy which had now become transparently clear to the
home government.</p>

<p class='c001'>The attitude of Massachusetts was, in fact, the crux of the
whole problem. The theocratical party there had developed
a theory,—based apparently upon an extension of the church-covenant
idea through the plantation covenant,—that the
charter itself was a covenant which reserved no rights to the
king and imperial government save those specifically mentioned.
From this she deduced that her obligation to the
Empire was so tenuous as to be virtually non-existent.<a id='r810'></a><a href='#f810' class='c014'><sup>[810]</sup></a> However
satisfactorily to themselves the leaders and their followers
might spin such theories, they did not agree with either the
economic, political, or legal facts. At this stage, the economic
welfare of the New England colonies was, of necessity, bound
up with that of the Empire, from the trade of which they would
be excluded if they ceased to be parts of it. Politically, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>had to be considered as either in it or out of it, and, obviously,
from the standpoint of abstract justice as well as of practical
administration, they could not consider themselves as now
one and now the other, according to their local interests at a
given moment.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor could it be conceded that, by the granting of the charters,
England had relinquished all rights of control, or the
power to determine whether or not their terms were being
complied with. That would have opened the way to the
grossest misuse of power by any of the local administrations
thus created, and would have been against public policy.
Moreover, in practically every charter, including that of Massachusetts,
the clause had appeared that no laws should be
passed repugnant to those of England. Massachusetts had
already passed many such, carrying with them, in some cases,
the penalty of capital punishment. The clause obviously
implied that there must be an authority somewhere, which
could decide whether the colonial laws were repugnant or
not; and it could hardly be claimed that the colonial courts
which passed them were intended to be the sole judges of
their conformity.<a id='r811'></a><a href='#f811' class='c014'><sup>[811]</sup></a> This would have meant that not only the
inhabitants of any chartered colony, but the citizens of all
the rest of the Empire having relations with it, directly or as
potential emigrants, would be absolutely at the mercy of the
local government, no matter what that government might do,
or however criminally it might disregard the rights that the
charters had specifically safeguarded. It must not be lost to
sight that the contemporary merchant in England or the West
Indies had as legitimate a right to require that England should
protect his legal interests in Massachusetts or Connecticut
as any citizen of the United States to-day has to expect that
his rights will be assured to him in New Mexico or Alaska. It
must also be recalled that America was the heritage of the
English people, much as our West was the heritage of our
citizens; and the Englishman, both for himself and for his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>children, had as legitimate an interest in the nature of the government
erected in any part of the Empire as we have in that
set up in any part of our territorial domains. There was
little more reason why a group of settlers should preëmpt
Massachusetts, pass laws repugnant to those of England, and
hang any Englishman whose political or religious views were
obnoxious to them, than there would be for the stockholders
and officers of a business corporation in Alaska, who might
have been granted land and some minor police powers, to do
the same thing to-day.</p>

<p class='c001'>If the contentions of Massachusetts were to be allowed,—that
she might pass any laws she chose and be sole judge of
them; that she might trample upon the colonial rights of Englishmen
at home, quarrel with her neighbors, determine her
own bounds, be the sole interpreter of the terms of her charter,
and sole judge of whether they had been complied with; deny
that the king's writ passed beyond England, or that the home
country had any right to pass laws affecting the colonies even
in their intercolonial and imperial relations,—then, it must
be confessed, there was no empire. There was merely an imperial
anarchy of conflicting local interests and warring elements,
whose only common bond was their claim that England
should protect them against the aggression of foreign and
land-hungry powers.</p>

<p class='c001'>If the rule of England in the seventeenth century had become
tyrannical and oppressive to the extent that revolution had
become justifiable, and if the colonies had become strong
enough, in the state of the world as it then was, to stand alone,
nothing could be said against their openly throwing off the
imperial yoke. The full development of the forces already at
work was, a century later, to bring about that very consummation,
the discussion of which belongs to a later period. That,
however, was not the case as yet, and the position which
Massachusetts assumed was untenable and could eventually
lead only to the loss of her charter, and not to independence.
Nor could she profess loyalty in the most obsequious terms,
claim all the military and commercial advantages of being a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>part of the Empire, and, at the same time, act as an independent
state. It was a policy which, however unjustifiable,
might be successful, perhaps, when essayed by her as the most
powerful member in a New England confederacy. It could
be neither, when the part was attempted to be played by that
same colony in its rôle of an unimportant dependency in a
great empire.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor had individual liberty anything to gain in the contest.
The only possible outcome would be the loss of the charter,
with all the possibilities involved in the then immediate dependence
upon a Stuart monarch. At this stage, the real
struggle for freedom, intellectual and political, was against
the theocracy. If its leaders lost the game they were playing,
as was practically inevitable, then the liberties of the colony,
as embodied in the charter and related to England, would
also be lost. If, on the other hand, they should by any chance
win against the Crown, then their own power would be greatly
strengthened and the struggle against them increased in
difficulty. In either event, therefore, the liberal element in
the colony had everything to fear from the policy pursued by
the leaders. That policy, however, from the standpoint of
the latter, found its justification in the fact that the suggested
alterations in the franchise, and other religious matters, would
end the power of the theocracy, which would surely go down
before liberty of opinion. As the leaders had already hesitated
at nothing, not even the blood of their victims, to maintain
their theory of the church-state, so now they preferred
to risk the practically certain loss of the charter and all its
civil privileges, rather than yield to the claim of individual
freedom. Fortunately, in spite of an apparent temporary success,
they were to lose, and England win; and, owing to the
people of England itself, the real cause of liberty was eventually
to gain.</p>

<p class='c001'>The chaotic state of New England had engaged the attention
of the Council for Plantations and the Privy Council almost
from the moment of the Restoration; while the sending
of Commissioners to adjust differences, and to report on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>conditions, had been under consideration since early in 1662.<a id='r812'></a><a href='#f812' class='c014'><sup>[812]</sup></a>
Two years later, action regarding the matters which had
been considered as of prime importance was taken at last,
and a commission was actually sent to New England; and
New Netherland, with little trouble, was wrested from the
Dutch. The two objects—of which the latter was considered
the more important—were closely connected, and the
most influential member of the Commission, Colonel Richard
Nicolls, was appointed Governor of the new province of
New York. Of the other three Commissioners, Samuel Maverick
was undoubtedly useful, from his great knowledge of
Massachusetts affairs, although otherwise unfitted, from his
strong partisanship; but neither Sir Robert Carr nor George
Cartwright possessed the qualifications to ensure successful results,
although the latter was able and conscientious in his
work.<a id='r813'></a><a href='#f813' class='c014'><sup>[813]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Two series of instructions were issued to the Commissioners
for their guidance, the one public and the other confidential,
as was also the custom of Massachusetts in sending agents
to England. In the first, it was ordered that the Commission
should consider the best means for reducing the Dutch, investigate
the condition of the Indians and of public education,
and see that the Navigation Acts were observed, and that,
according to the laws of England, no one was debarred from
the free exercise of his religion. In the confidential instructions,
these points were repeated with additional details, the
Commissioners being further required to examine the various
charters and the laws passed; to have, if possible, a General
Assembly elected in Massachusetts, in which the members
would be favorably inclined toward the King, and to have an
acceptable governor and commander of the militia appointed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>or elected. They were to try to secure the coöperation of the
other four colonies, and, in both sets of orders, were instructed
to avoid giving offense.<a id='r814'></a><a href='#f814' class='c014'><sup>[814]</sup></a> The King also wrote a conciliatory
letter to each of the colonies, in which he spoke of the calumnies
against them, the difficulty of settling boundary disputes
among themselves, and other matters requiring investigation
and settlement.<a id='r815'></a><a href='#f815' class='c014'><sup>[815]</sup></a> In the commissions issued to Nicolls and
the others, they were empowered to hear complaints and
appeals, and to take measures for settling the peace of the
country.<a id='r816'></a><a href='#f816' class='c014'><sup>[816]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In Massachusetts the news of the sending of the Commissioners
created considerable alarm, and the General Court
passed orders that none of their force of under-officers or
soldiers should be allowed to land, except unarmed and in
small numbers. The fort on Castle Island was ordered to
be manned and prepared, sentries posted, and the charter
hidden.<a id='r817'></a><a href='#f817' class='c014'><sup>[817]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In July, the Commissioners arrived at Boston, and presented
their commissions and the King's letter to the Court,
together with that part of their instructions which related to
raising a force against the Dutch. The request was complied
with, and the Court also hastily passed a new election law,
which ostensibly made the franchise independent of a religious
test, but which in practice could have no such effect. According
to the new law, all church members, regardless of property
qualifications, were given the franchise, as before, but non-church
members were required to be freeholders and householders,
to present certificates signed by ministers that they
were orthodox in belief and not vicious in their lives, to be
elected as freemen by the General Court, and to possess an
estate which paid a tax of ten shillings in a single levy. There
were other requirements, also; but the fact that not one man
in a hundred was said to have the property qualification required
only from non-church members showed the farcical
nature of the law. The enactment has sometimes been called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>“shrewd”; but, in reality, it deceived no one, least of all the
Commissioners, and its obvious disingenuousness served only
to prejudice the case of the colony still further. Yet, in
writing to the King, the colonial government stated that, in
passing this law, they had applied themselves “to the utmost
to sattisfy” him in “so farr as doth consist with conscience of
our duty towards God, and the just liberties and priviledges”
of their patent.<a id='r818'></a><a href='#f818' class='c014'><sup>[818]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Nor was the character of the rest of the petition, or of the
letters which they wrote, asking aid, to Boyle, the head of the
Society for Propagating the Gospel, and to Lord Clarendon, of
a sort likely to improve the opinion held regarding the colony.
It was obviously impossible to comply with their request to
withdraw the Commission. In a just and temperate reply,
the King pointed out that investigation by such a body
had been the only method left to the English government to
inform itself as to conditions in the colonies. Nor did Boyle
take any different view of the matter; and Clarendon wrote
of the petition: “I am so much a friend to your colony, that
if it had been communicated to nobody but myself, I should
have disswaded the presenting the same to his Majesty”; and
pointed out the impossible character of the complaints and
demands.<a id='r819'></a><a href='#f819' class='c014'><sup>[819]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The double nature of the Commissioners' duties now served
to interrupt their work in Massachusetts; and until the beginning
of the following year, they were occupied at New Amsterdam,
and on the Delaware, in settling matters in the conquered
Dutch colony—among others, the adjustment of its
boundary with Connecticut. The case of the boundary between
that colony and Rhode Island also came up; and although
the final disposition was left for the home government,
it was settled, in so far as the colonies were concerned, by
erecting the disputed territory into a separate province, to be
known as the King's Province. The jurisdiction was given to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>Rhode Island, while the claims of Massachusetts and the Atherton
Land Company were properly declared invalid.<a id='r820'></a><a href='#f820' class='c014'><sup>[820]</sup></a></p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Throughout their dealings with Connecticut, Rhode Island,
and Plymouth, the Commissioners had met with little or no
opposition; and it was only upon their reassembling at Boston,
about the first of May, 1665, that the real struggle began.<a id='r821'></a><a href='#f821' class='c014'><sup>[821]</sup></a>
Endicott had recently died, and Bellingham had been elected
governor. The negotiations between the new government
and the Commissioners, however, were entered upon with
some bad feeling upon both sides. The Commissioners had
previously asked that all the inhabitants be summoned to
attend the Court, in order that the King's views might be
made known to them directly; but this somewhat impossible
plan had been discouraged, if not secretly hindered, by the
colonial government, and many false statements regarding the
Commission had also been circulated, tending to throw discredit
upon them—all of which they naturally resented.<a id='r822'></a><a href='#f822' class='c014'><sup>[822]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Commissioners now made known all of their public
instructions, and the Court made answer to their various requests
and accusations. In regard to some of the minor matters,
such as public education, there was no difficulty; but
in regard to the more important ones, except issuing writs in
the King's name, the colony virtually had no case. The new
oath of allegiance, which the Court had had drawn up, had
been purposely vitiated by the insertion of a clause referring
to the charter, and can be considered only as an attempt to
deceive the Commissioners and the home government, which
it failed to do. As to ecclesiastical matters, the Court stated
merely that they followed “the word of the Lord,” which, as
they denied any interpretation of that word except their own,
meant that they followed their own opinions, and refused to
allow any one else to have any. Their statement, in a later
paper, that “the authority here have not imposed upon church
or people any one particular forme or order, for the restreijning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>or limiting them in the exercise of their devotions towards
God,” and their reference to “the great freedome” in religious
matters, is startling in its distortion of the truth, in view of
the laws then on their statute-books, and of their consistent
course of persecution, from the Brownes in 1628 to the last
Quaker hung in 1660. In response to another request of the
English government, at this very time, they flatly denied permission
to any law-abiding citizen to use his prayer-book, on
the ground that “it will disturbe our peace in our present enjoyments.”
Referring to the Navigation Acts, they could
make no better defense than to say that they were not conscious
that they had “greatly violated the same,” and that
any laws apparently against them had been repealed.<a id='r823'></a><a href='#f823' class='c014'><sup>[823]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It is needless to follow the details of the controversy, which
culminated in the struggle over the question of appeals.
These had already been heard in Rhode Island by the Commissioners,
under the authority of somewhat conflicting clauses
in their instructions and commissions; and it was now undertaken
to hear two in Boston. One of them concerned an
individual, who seems to have been of a worthless sort, and
the other, a violation of the Navigation Act. The General
Court refused to allow the proceedings, claimed a breach of the
charter, and officially warned all citizens not to attend the
hearings, which were never held, as the Commissioners had no
force to uphold their authority, even had they cared to employ
it.<a id='r824'></a><a href='#f824' class='c014'><sup>[824]</sup></a> Soon after this, the Commission left Boston, both the colony
and the King's officers making long reports to the government
in England.<a id='r825'></a><a href='#f825' class='c014'><sup>[825]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The whole contest had now obviously reached the fundamental
point of sovereignty, which was clearly stated in a
letter to Massachusetts, a few weeks later, from Carr, Cartwright,
and Maverick, who were then in New Hampshire.
“The King did not grant away his Soveraigntie over you,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>they wrote, “when he made you a Corporation. When His
Majesty gave you power to make wholesome laws and to administer
Justice by them, he parted not with his right of judging
whether those laws were wholesom or whether justice was
administered accordingly or no. When His Majesty gave
you authority over such of his subjects as lived within the
limits of your jurisdiction, he made them not your subjects
nor you their supream authority.” Unpalatable as these words
may have been to the Massachusetts Court, there can be no
doubt that they expressed the truth, as did also the Commissioners'
warning that “striveing to grasp too much, may make
you hold but a little.” The future was clearly fore-shadowed.
“'Tis possible that the Charter which you so much idolize
may be forfeited,” the Commissioners added, “until you have
cleared yourselves of those many injustices, oppressions, violences,
and bloud for which you are complained against, to
which complaints you have refused to answer.”<a id='r826'></a><a href='#f826' class='c014'><sup>[826]</sup></a> There was,
indeed, to be no other course. If Massachusetts under her
charter should persist in considering herself superior to the
power which had granted it, that power would have no option
but to recognize her complete independence or to annul the
charter.</p>

<p class='c001'>In New Hampshire, the acts of the three Commissioners
were ill-judged and but little likely to reflect credit upon the
King, or to secure the adherence of the people, while Massachusetts
by prompt and forceful measures asserted her claims
in the face of the royal agents.<a id='r827'></a><a href='#f827' class='c014'><sup>[827]</sup></a> In Maine, the latter attempted
to organize a temporary government, pending the settlement
of the dispute between Massachusetts and Gorges, and they
likewise endeavored, even more unsuccessfully, to set up
administrative machinery in the territory east of Pemaquid,
which had been granted to the Duke of York. Within less
than three years, Massachusetts, assisted by the desire of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>inhabitants for a settled government, had once more taken
the province under her jurisdiction, although not without
local opposition.<a id='r828'></a><a href='#f828' class='c014'><sup>[828]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In what had been considered their most important work,
the reduction of the Dutch and the establishment of the English
authority at New York, the Commissioners had been entirely
successful, as they had been also in their relations with the
three southern colonies in New England; and the settlement
of the dispute between Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode
Island, and the Atherton Company was of great benefit to
the colonies. In the matter of Massachusetts, however, they
had completely failed. Three of them advised taking away
the charter, while Maverick made several suggestions, including
the prohibiting of trade with the recalcitrant colony,
as did Nicolls also.<a id='r829'></a><a href='#f829' class='c014'><sup>[829]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In 1666, the King sent a circular letter to the various colonies,
expressing satisfaction with all except Massachusetts, whose
claim of independent sovereignty, he noted, was “a matter of
such high consequence as every man discerns where it must
end”; and he commanded the colony to send four or five
agents to England, including Bellingham and Hathorne, to
answer the charges against her.<a id='r830'></a><a href='#f830' class='c014'><sup>[830]</sup></a> This the Court flatly refused
to do, and so notified the King, though they sent him their
prayers for his eternal happiness.<a id='r831'></a><a href='#f831' class='c014'><sup>[831]</sup></a> Their refusal, however, by
no means met with unanimous approval among the influential
elements in the colony. A petition was presented to the Court,
signed by a hundred and seventy-one individuals, including
such names as Winslow, Brattle, Gerrish, Hale, Coffin, Perkins,
Hubbard, and others of note in Boston, Salem, Newbury, and
Ipswich, while most of the people of Hingham were said to have
signed also, although their deputy refused to deliver their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>petition.<a id='r832'></a><a href='#f832' class='c014'><sup>[832]</sup></a> The signers pleaded that nothing further be done
justly to offend the home government, and that the agents
asked for be sent. They pointed out that “the doubtful interpretation
of the words of a patent, which there can be no
reason should ever be construed to the divesting of a sovereign
prince of his royall power over his naturall subjects and liege
people, is too frail a foundation to build such a transcendent
immunity and privilege upon.”<a id='r833'></a><a href='#f833' class='c014'><sup>[833]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But those attempting to maintain the power of the theocracy
would not be turned from their course, though by it
they made the eventual loss of the charter both necessary and
certain. Owing to the fact that England was now at war with
both Holland and France, neither time nor thought could be
given to a rebellious colony, and Massachusetts was to be
allowed to go her way for another decade. Her own rulers,
however, had definitely determined what her fate should be
when the authorities in England should once more be free
to act. In a little more than that period, she was to find herself,
without a charter and without a friend, defenseless before
the last of the Stuarts; and it was only the final revolt of
the people of England against that dynasty which was to save
her from the full effects of the policy of her theocracy, and to
secure to all her citizens the same measure of political equality
that was enjoyed by their neighbors.</p>

Quakers from persecution. For that reason, and because he was said to have written
a “blasphemous” letter against the New England magistrates, New Haven seized
£100 belonging to Giles Sylvester until he should give satisfaction, if the charges,
which were noted as hearsay, should be proved. Considering that the New Haven
settlers were mere squatters without any legal rights, that Sylvester properly denied
their jurisdiction over him, and that the amount, equivalent to about $2000 to-day,
was illegally seized on merely hearsay evidence that Sylvester had criticized them,
the case may be taken as showing the possibilities for strangers of Puritan colonial
justice. <cite>New Haven Records</cite>, vol. <span class='fss'>II</span>, p. 364.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XIV <br> <br> THE INEVITABLE CONFLICT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>During the quarter of a century preceding 1675, the growth
of the New England colonies, both in numbers and resources,
had been marked. Their refusal, on the one hand, to observe
such of the imperial laws as might in any way hamper their
commerce, and, on the other, the opportunities offered by the
growth of the Empire, under those laws, had resulted in an
enormous expansion, comparatively, in the colonies' intercolonial
and foreign trade. With no Indian war of any magnitude
for a generation, and with ample areas of free land upon
which to expand, the frontier extended rapidly, and the population
doubled. At the opening of the inter-racial conflict
which is the subject of this chapter, the settlers probably
numbered about fifty-two thousand, of whom approximately
thirty-seven thousand were located in the seaboard colonies
from Maine to Plymouth, three thousand in Rhode Island, and
twelve thousand in Connecticut.<a id='r834'></a><a href='#f834' class='c014'><sup>[834]</sup></a> The numbers of the Indians
can be estimated with even less certainty than those of
the whites; but it is probable that the colonists outnumbered
them by at least four to one.<a id='r835'></a><a href='#f835' class='c014'><sup>[835]</sup></a> The Narragansetts, who were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>by far the most numerous, as well as the most powerful, may
have counted five thousand individuals in all.<a id='r836'></a><a href='#f836' class='c014'><sup>[836]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The geographical relations of the two races had been almost
as greatly altered, in a generation, as had their numerical proportions.
At the time of the Pequot war, in 1637, at least
four fifths of the entire white population formed a compact
mass along the eastern shore of the present state of Massachusetts.
The scattered settlements of Maine and New
Hampshire, the handful of people about Narragansett Bay,
and the beginnings of the River Towns in Connecticut, were
but isolated outposts in what was otherwise an unbroken
wilderness, peopled only by the savages. The whites were
thus hemmed in on every side except the ocean.<a id='r837'></a><a href='#f837' class='c014'><sup>[837]</sup></a> By 1675,
the situation in southern New England had been completely
reversed. The settled area, which by that year extended
westward from the sea one third of the way across Massachusetts,
was continued from Cape Cod along the Sound and up
the Connecticut River, and the western Massachusetts towns
were scattered up the valley of the latter as far as Northfield.
It was now the Indian who found himself, not simply far
outnumbered, but entirely surrounded, by his white neighbors.
It was only in the northeastern settlements, where the
English population was much sparser, and where the short
rivers and broken uplands offered no attractions to tempt the
settlers from the coast, that the earlier conditions still prevailed,
and the savages as yet had free range.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the Puritan colonies, the practical identity of church and
town, and the whole social, religious, and political life of the
people precluded any wide dispersal of individual settlers in
the wilderness. Even when individuals wished to go off by
themselves, they were, as a rule, not allowed to do so, and
Plymouth was not the only colony to take drastic measures to
discipline such as preferred “liveing lonely and in a heathenish
way from good societie.”<a id='r838'></a><a href='#f838' class='c014'><sup>[838]</sup></a> The unit of the southern New
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>England frontier was not the solitary hunter or trapper, not
even the family of the pioneer farmer, but the town. When
a bit of the wilderness was cleared, it was to plant therein,
not an isolated cabin, but the homes of an organized community,
fully equipped with a church and town government,
destined, almost at once, to be a new centre of civilization alien
to the savage, permanent, irremovable, expanding. When
a French trader or trapper plunged into the forest, and the
green leaves closed behind him, it was to mingle with the
life of the natives, which, in its main aspects, flowed on
unaltered by his presence. When, on the other hand, Englishmen
cleared their fields, built a town and a church, and by
virtue of their title-deeds claimed undivided ownership of
their newly acquired square miles of land, it was as if they had
planted a great rock in the stream of savage life, which must
thereafter flow around this new obstruction. As the English
frontier crept ever farther and farther inland, from the shores
of ocean and Sound, and up the valleys of such streams as
the Merrimac, Thames, or Connecticut, and town succeeded
town, it was as if, adding stone to stone, great dykes were
being built, which more and more dammed up the waters of
native life. It was almost inevitable that a point would be
reached when these imprisoned waters would burst forth, and
possibly carry away all New England in their flood.</p>

<p class='c001'>The land-hunger of the whites, however, was insatiable.
Almost any trouble with the natives became a sufficient
excuse for an extorted cession of territory, either immediate
or deferred. From the very beginning, the English had recognized
an Indian title to the country, as distinct from the rights
conveyed by the king in his patents. Indeed, in view of the
use to which the settlers wished to put the lands, and the
basis upon which they necessarily lived in relation to the native
occupants, they could not well do otherwise, and peaceful
possession was cheaply secured at the expense of a few coats
or hoes. But, as we saw in an earlier chapter, the Indian
theory of ownership was entirely different from that of the
whites; and although the English, for the most part, observed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>the legal forms of their own race, the parchments which the
savage signed with his mark were as ethically invalid as a
child's sale of his inheritance for a stick of candy. Not only,
in the beginning, had the natives failed to understand the
nature of the transaction itself, but in their utter ignorance of
Europe, and of what was bound to ensue from the steady
stream of emigration thence, they could not foresee—what
was reasonably clear to the colonists—that the result of their
having welcomed the stranger would eventually be their own
annihilation or completely altered status.</p>

<p class='c001'>Whatever may be thought of the abstract justice of the
earlier purchases, as the whites increased in numbers and comparative
power, and as their first fears of the savages, and
the desire to convert them, gave place to dislike, contempt,
spiritual indifference, and self-confidence, their dealings with
them sank to a lower ethical plane. It took but a few years
for the methods of land-acquisition to become greatly modified.
It was no longer considered necessary to treat with the Indian
as an equal, whose just title could be acquired only for a
valuable consideration. The theory was formulated that the
native could be punished for a breach of the Englishman's
laws, and that the fine or damage imposed might take the
form of a cession of land. Troubles with the savages, on a
larger scale, resulted in making use of the title by conquest,
by which the larger part of Connecticut was acquired. Later,
in the case of the Narragansetts, as we have already seen,
overdue tribute, of questionable validity, was used by a
speculative land company as a basis for advancing money on
mortgage, by means of which it was hoped to obtain the rich
territorial possessions of that entire tribe. All the colonies,
indeed, in order to protect the Indians from the commoner
forms of fraud, and themselves from the dangerous results of
disputes, had made it illegal for individuals to bargain for
land; and the laws requiring the general courts to pass upon all
land-dealings were wise and just, and, undoubtedly, prevented
much petty trickery and mischief. It is needless to point out,
however, the subtle temptation for the colonies to pick a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>quarrel with the natives, to interfere with their internal affairs,
or to conduct some little military expedition, when the result
was likely to be the acquisition of desirable lands by a mere
show of force.</p>

<p class='c001'>As the whites encroached more and more upon the Indians,
the lands of the latter gradually came to be looked upon as
reservations, upon which their native owners were allowed to
live until a convenient opportunity, or the growing needs of
the settlers, might bring about a farther advance. Moreover,
as the Indian lands dwindled in extent, and the whites rapidly
increased numerically, in proportion to the natives, the settlers
adopted an attitude of superiority and authority over the
native tribes. This really amounted to establishing a protectorate
over them, and relegated them to the rank of dependent
peoples shorn of all sovereign power. It was a natural
evolution in the relations between the two races, but was no
more acceptable to the Indians for that reason. Nor were
the Puritans, who were by nature harsh and overbearing, and
who failed to display even the ordinary good manners of the
time in their dealings with the Dutch, likely to exhibit any
great amount of tact or courtesy in those which they had with
the despised heathen and “children of the devil.” Personal
pride and a strict observance of etiquette were marked characteristics
of the savages, and chiefs and sachems could not fail
to be stung to the quick when they were summoned, with
more and more frequency, and less and less courtesy, to travel
long distances and answer to complaints before the courts of
Plymouth or Massachusetts, with but little regard for their
dignity or standing among their own people.</p>

<p class='c001'>Not seldom, moreover, they knew that such a demand was
but the prelude to extending English authority, and sending
them home shorn of possessions and respect. To cite, as an
example, a case somewhat closely connected with the events
of this chapter, in 1671, as a sequel to a rumored rising of the
Indians in Plymouth Colony, the Squaw Sachem Awashunks
was summoned to appear; and having done so voluntarily,
she was required to submit “the disposall of her lands to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>authoritie” of the colony, and was forced to engage herself
to pay £50, to recompense the English for their trouble in
the matter. As it was impossible that she could pay any such
sum, the eventual “disposall” of her lands would not be difficult
to foresee.<a id='r839'></a><a href='#f839' class='c014'><sup>[839]</sup></a> Land, as Roger Williams wrote, was becoming
“one of the gods of New England,” and judicial punishments
were coming curiously often to involve forced concessions
regarding coveted bits of territory. Subtly, and perhaps
unconsciously, but no less surely, the land-hunger of the whites
was poisoning the wells of justice.</p>

<p class='c001'>As a result of the relations, territorial and political, which
were developing between the races, and as a natural corollary
of the protectorate theory, the English were also gradually
enacting, on the one hand, a body of law applicable among
themselves to the Indian only, and, on the other, forcing the
“protected” Indians to observe English law, even when living
apart from the settlers. Such regulations as Connecticut
passed for the Pequots on their reservation in the spring of
1675 were evidence of what all the protected Indians might
expect in time. Any native, for example, heathen or Christian,
who profaned the Sabbath day by hunting, fishing, carrying
firewood, or other misdemeanors, was to be fined or
whipped; while all were ordered to “heare the word of God
preached by Mr. Fitch, or any other minister sent amongst
them,” subject to four shillings fine or corporal punishment.<a id='r840'></a><a href='#f840' class='c014'><sup>[840]</sup></a>
A most unjust law, in view of the well-understood inability
of the Indian to withstand the temptation of strong waters,
and the willingness of the colonists, in spite of legal prohibition,
to sell them to him, was that which provided that any
native found drunk should have to labor twelve days for whoever
accused him and proved the case, one half of the proceeds
of his labor to go to the accuser, and one half to the county
treasury. It was only necessary, therefore, secretly to induce
a savage to take one or two drinks, in order to secure six days'
forced labor from him <span lang="la"><i>gratis</i></span>.<a id='r841'></a><a href='#f841' class='c014'><sup>[841]</sup></a> We need not credit the preposterous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>contemporary accusation that the Massachusetts
government, under a similar law, connived at making Indians
drunk, so as to hasten the work on Castle Island, in order to
realize the ample possibilities for evil in such a statute.<a id='r842'></a><a href='#f842' class='c014'><sup>[842]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The close proximity in which the whites and natives dwelt
in many places was the source of endless friction and petty
annoyance, particularly to the Indians. The live-stock of
the settlers was forever being allowed to stray into the cultivated
lands of the savages; and at the time of the troubles in
1671, the colony of Plymouth had to appoint committees in
no less than eleven different towns, “to view the Damage done
to the Indians by the Horses and Hoggs of the English.”<a id='r843'></a><a href='#f843' class='c014'><sup>[843]</sup></a>
The question of firearms was the subject of frequent legislation
by the colonial courts, and of friction with the natives,
in the altered condition of whose life they had become practically
essential as a means of procuring food.<a id='r844'></a><a href='#f844' class='c014'><sup>[844]</sup></a> Notwithstanding
this fact, and the obvious one that the guns, having
been paid for by the Indians with their own money, were their
property, the English, frequently, when alarmed by rumors
of hostility, required that the savages deliver all their arms
into the hands of the authorities, considering as enemies those
who refused.<a id='r845'></a><a href='#f845' class='c014'><sup>[845]</sup></a> Not only was this a hardship and a humiliation,
but, on a number of occasions, the English refused to
return the weapons, simply confiscating them. In 1671, for
example, in Plymouth, after Philip had been required to
deposit the guns of his people with the Court, that body determined
that they were “justly forfeit,” and coolly divided them
among the towns of the colony.<a id='r846'></a><a href='#f846' class='c014'><sup>[846]</sup></a> At one stroke, not only
were the natives deprived of their means of livelihood and
defense, but the weapons, which they had honestly bought,
were thus, by legalized robbery, turned against themselves.
No individual with the instinct of self-respect and self-preservation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>could fail to see that his eventual choice would lie
between resistance and virtual slavery.</p>

<p class='c001'>The missionary efforts of the English differed from those
of the French precisely as did their exploitation of the land.
In French America, the religious counterpart of the lonely
trapper or trader was the Jesuit priest, who, cross in hand,
and frequently without a companion, penetrated to the far
depths of the forest, to carry his message to the heathen
wherever found. In New England, however, as it was the
town and not the trader that pushed the frontier forward, so
the lonely missionary was replaced by the organizer of communities,
and the savages on the fringe of civilization were
gathered into villages within the bounds of white settlement,
there to have the gospel preached to them, and to be joined in
a covenanted church. Such work was practically negligible
in Rhode Island and Connecticut, but, by the outbreak of
Philip's War, had made considerable progress in Massachusetts
and Plymouth. In the latter two colonies, the labors of the
Reverend John Eliot, who had translated the Bible into the
Indian tongue, of Thomas Mayhew, Richard Bourne, and
others,—paid for almost wholly with funds raised in England,—had
resulted in the gathering of perhaps four thousand
converts.<a id='r847'></a><a href='#f847' class='c014'><sup>[847]</sup></a> A considerable number of these “Praying Indians,”
as they were called, were scattered in villages on Martha's
Vineyard and Nantucket, and in some twenty localities in
Plymouth, and about eleven hundred were located in Massachusetts.
Of the latter, the earlier and most dependable
ones dwelt in the seven towns of Chelmsford, Littleton, Natick,
Marlborough, Hopkinton, Grafton, and Stoughton, which
were located at intervals of a dozen miles or so along the
frontier of the eastern settlements, and which might have been
used as a possible line of defense against any hostile movement
from the unoccupied central portion of the colony, which lay
between them and the towns of the Connecticut River.<a id='r848'></a><a href='#f848' class='c014'><sup>[848]</sup></a> In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>a large proportion of cases, the conversion seems to have been
genuine, and the Indians, more particularly in the seven
towns named, to have become sincere friends of the English,
although the more recent converts in the Nipmuck country
soon went over to the enemy.</p>

<p class='c001'>To the bulk of the savages, however, the humdrum existence
led by their praying brethren in the little reservations allotted
to them by the English, and their position of humble dependence
upon the white lords of the soil, could hardly make a
serious appeal. The past was too recent, and its contrast with
the present was too vivid. It was becoming clear to the dullest
witted that the future could hold little else, however, unless the
power of the whites could be broken once and for all.</p>

<p class='c001'>Massasoit, the aged Sachem of the Wampanoags, who had
been a consistent friend to the settlers since 1620, died in
the winter of 1660-61, and his son Alexander, who succeeded
him, also died a few months later. In fact, his death is said to
have been due, in part, to his anger and chagrin at having
been forcibly seized by the authorities of Plymouth when called
upon to make his appearance before them.<a id='r849'></a><a href='#f849' class='c014'><sup>[849]</sup></a> The change of
relations between the whites and Indians was well exemplified
by the difference between the formal and dignified embassy
sent from Plymouth in 1620, to visit Massasoit and to negotiate
a treaty with him, and the “eight or ten stout men,”
under Major Winslow, who surprised Alexander in his hunting-lodge,
seized his arms, and commanded him to travel to that
same Plymouth, to appear before the governor.</p>

<p class='c001'>Philip had not long succeeded his brother Alexander as
sachem, when he, in turn, was curtly summoned to appear
before the Court, to clear himself of rumored disloyalty.
Although nothing whatever was proved, and Philip offered to
leave another of his brothers as hostage, he was forced to sign
a treaty ratifying all former ones, acknowledge himself an
English subject, and agree not to alienate any of his lands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>without the consent of the Court.<a id='r850'></a><a href='#f850' class='c014'><sup>[850]</sup></a> Five years later, on renewed
rumors of his disloyalty, his arms were taken away,
and he was again forced to appear before the magistrates.
Although once more no evidence was produced against him,
and his arms were returned, he was nevertheless required to
give his note for £40 as part of the charge for the expedition
which had been sent after him.<a id='r851'></a><a href='#f851' class='c014'><sup>[851]</sup></a> In 1671, for wholly inadequate
causes, he was forced, not to make a new treaty, but,
without option, to sign “several propositions,” by one of
which he had to agree to pay a fine of “one hundred pounds
in such things as I have,” although, as he had no such sum,
he asked for three years in which to pay it. He was also
required to acknowledge himself in subjection, not merely
to the English Crown, but to the little colony of Plymouth;
to pay an annual tribute; to sell land only subject to the
colony's approval; and, with exceeding unfairness, to agree
in advance to submit, in case of any dispute between the
colony and himself, to the verdict of the governor as arbitrator.<a id='r852'></a><a href='#f852' class='c014'><sup>[852]</sup></a>
It was on this occasion, as already noted, that all
the guns that his people had delivered to the English were
confiscated.</p>

<p class='c001'>This treatment, accorded to the son of that sachem to whom
the now grasping colony had, in its infancy, owed its very life,
and who had been its friend for over forty years, could not
fail to goad him into rebellion, if, indeed, he had not already
considered it. Within four years from the time when the son
of Massasoit affixed his scrawling mark to the humiliating and
confiscatory document, the storm broke which was to drench
New England in a sea of blood.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the absence of any written records of the Indians, from
which the story of those four years or so of preparation upon
their part might be ascertained, the nature and scope of Philip's
plans must remain wholly a matter of inference from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>subsequent events. That he nursed his revenge, and carried
on negotiations with other tribes for a simultaneous rising
against the whites over a considerable territory, would seem
to be well established. On the other hand, the time was more
or less ripe for the inevitable conflict to occur throughout all
the colonies. Once started, the example of a native rising
would prove contagious; and there is little evidence to prove
that the widespread movements along the seaboard were connected
by threads that centred in the hut of the Wampanoag.
His tribe itself was weak and inconspicuous, and in Philip's
apparent lack of personal bravery and some of the other
qualities most admired in a savage leader, there is nothing
to indicate—what, indeed, events tend to disprove—that
he was personally popular among the natives. Nor, even if
we grant that he was surprised into hostilities in that spring
of 1675, before all his plans had matured, is there any evidence,
in his later conduct of the campaign, of that great
ability for organization which has sometimes been attributed
to him. There seems to be no doubt, however, that at
that time he was engaged in preparing for a general rising,
and that he had the sympathy of some of the other New
England tribes.</p>

<p class='c001'>Meanwhile, the English seem to have been singularly oblivious
to the realities of the situation. They claimed, and undoubtedly
felt, that they had treated the natives with justice.
In the beginning, they had naturally failed to understand the
Indian character, government, and theory of property. As,
on the one hand, they came to know these better, on the other,
the contempt they developed for the heathen and the savage,
who, incidentally, was in possession of lands coveted by the
Saints of God, tended to lessen their belief in his abstract
rights. Economically, they had outgrown their early dependence
upon the native; and their increasing sense of safety,
due to the rapidly developing disparity in numbers, tended to
make them callous to the feelings of the “great naked dirty
beast,” as Colonel Church described Philip, and they ceased
to fear the power of the savage without coming to respect the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>rights of the man.<a id='r853'></a><a href='#f853' class='c014'><sup>[853]</sup></a> They failed to realize the broader aspects
of the struggle, and even the practical fact that they were
driving a still powerful race of savages into a corner, where
they were not likely to stand at bay without making, at some
time, a supreme effort to escape.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the Indians finally did strike back, the English not
only were wholly unprepared but do not seem to have understood
the results of their own acts. Instead of regarding the
approaching conflict as an inevitable consequence of the
relations between the two races, and as having been, more
immediately, brought about by themselves, they looked upon
it as sent from God; and in a hasty self-examination as to why
the Deity should have so afflicted them, the Massachusetts
General Court decided that He was then engaged in burning
towns and murdering women and children along the frontier,
because Massachusetts had become somewhat lax in persecuting
the Quakers, and because her men had begun to wear
periwigs and their women to indulge in “cutting, curling and
immodest laying out theire haire.”<a id='r854'></a><a href='#f854' class='c014'><sup>[854]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The genius of New England has never been military. Her
people, in a cause in which they believe, can fight doggedly
and well, but she has never given to the nation a great soldier,
either as leader or organizer, and King Philip's War presented
no exception. From its nature, it was less a war than a series
of raids by the savages and retaliatory expeditions by the English;
but it was the only sort of war which the colonies could
have expected, or for which they ought to have been prepared.
There was, however, practically no intercolonial organization.
The United Colonies, the efficiency of which as a war-machine
had early been damaged by Massachusetts, had received another
blow by the loss of a member when New Haven was absorbed
by Connecticut. Although Plymouth's suggestion, at
that time, to dissolve the Confederacy entirely, had not been
approved, the bond had become looser than ever, and under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>the altered articles, the representatives of the three remaining
members were to meet only triennially.<a id='r855'></a><a href='#f855' class='c014'><sup>[855]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In spite of the invaluable material that the colonies possessed
in the friendly Indians, none of them had been employed as
spies among the enemy, of whose plans preceding the war the
colonists seem to have had no information other than vague
rumors. In spite of their experience, moreover, the settlers
appear, in part, to have been curiously ignorant of Indian
warfare. Even in the matter of weapons, they made the
mistake, at first, of equipping men with the wholly useless
pike; and in the earliest expeditions, the English carried the
cumbrous old matchlock guns, which were much inferior to
the newer flintlocks used by the savages.<a id='r856'></a><a href='#f856' class='c014'><sup>[856]</sup></a> The commissariat
frequently broke down, and in a number of cases important
expeditions had to be abandoned because of failure of supplies.
The regulation, necessary on account of the jealousy of the
several colonies, that, in joint operations, the ranking officer
of the colony in which the operations happened to be conducted
at the moment should be the commander-in-chief of the whole,
naturally made friction and tended to confusion.<a id='r857'></a><a href='#f857' class='c014'><sup>[857]</sup></a> From the
same spirit of jealousy, there also arose disputes, sometimes
almost amounting to mutiny, between the troops of one colony
and those of another, which were further fostered by the lack
of unity in plans, and inadequate communication.<a id='r858'></a><a href='#f858' class='c014'><sup>[858]</sup></a> Insubordination
was not always limited to the rank and file, and in
the case of Colonel Moseley,—who had married a niece of
Governor Leverett of Massachusetts,—rose to such a point,
against both his superior officers and the state, as should have
brought him to a court-martial.<a id='r859'></a><a href='#f859' class='c014'><sup>[859]</sup></a> As the war progressed, the
difficulty of raising troops became great, both from lack of men
in some places and from their disinclination to serve. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>Plymouth, it was ordered that boys under the military age of
sixteen should be used for guard-duty; while any man pressed
for service who refused to obey should be fined five pounds, or
made to run the gauntlet, or both.<a id='r860'></a><a href='#f860' class='c014'><sup>[860]</sup></a> Connecticut had to offer
her troops, officers as well as men, the plunder of the Indians,
as to both their goods and their persons, in addition to the
regular pay, and to forbid any male resident between the
ages of fourteen and seventy to emigrate from the colony.<a id='r861'></a><a href='#f861' class='c014'><sup>[861]</sup></a>
Massachusetts, “taking into consideration the great disappointment”
that soldiers pressed for duty refused to serve,
provided that those who continued refractory should be
punished with death.<a id='r862'></a><a href='#f862' class='c014'><sup>[862]</sup></a> On the other hand, the drab coloring
of the war, uninspiring as the conflict was in many of its aspects,
was relieved over and over by exhibitions of a fine courage
on the part of individual soldiers, and of a cool daring in the
face of unspeakable horrors, shown by women as well as men.</p>

<p class='c001'>The character of the war would, in any case, probably have
been mainly a series of raids; but the fact that Philip had
apparently to enter upon hostilities before his preparations
were complete, and the lack of unity and organized effective
action among the colonies, made the course of the contest
even more desultory than it might otherwise have been. We
cannot here give more than an outline of the chief events of
the struggle, which was more important in its results than in
its conduct.<a id='r863'></a><a href='#f863' class='c014'><sup>[863]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In the latter part of 1674, John Sassamon, a Christian Indian,
discovered a plot among the natives of Namasket, and
immediately informed the authorities of Plymouth, stating
that he would be in danger of his life if Philip should learn
of his disclosures.<a id='r864'></a><a href='#f864' class='c014'><sup>[864]</sup></a> His fears were fulfilled, and in January,
1675, he was murdered, apparently by Philip's orders, the
three Indians implicated in his death being seized, tried,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>and executed by the English in the following spring.<a id='r865'></a><a href='#f865' class='c014'><sup>[865]</sup></a> The
Squaw-Sachem Weetamoo, who seems to have been opposed
to the rising, although she was the sister-in-law of Philip,
also warned the English of what was planned; but they do not
seem to have taken any measures for defense, or to have done
anything at all beyond remonstrating with Philip.<a id='r866'></a><a href='#f866' class='c014'><sup>[866]</sup></a> He had
already committed himself too far, however, to have drawn
back, even if he would; and, in spite of the premature discovery
of the design, the younger warriors from neighboring
tribes began to come in and urge the immediate beginning of
hostilities.</p>

<p class='c001'>On June 24, at Swansea, after having provoked a settler
to draw the first blood, the savages fell upon the whites, and
killed eight or nine. Two more, who had been dispatched to
get a surgeon, were waylaid and slain, and their bodies found
by an embassy then on its way from the government of Plymouth
to Philip. In the six months since the English had
been told of the plot, they had been strangely inactive. Two
days after the murders at Swansea, however, five companies
were mustered, partly in Plymouth and partly in Boston, and
were on the march.<a id='r867'></a><a href='#f867' class='c014'><sup>[867]</sup></a> A raid on the Indians by these united
forces, on the 30th, so frightened the savages, that Philip and
his followers fled from Mount Hope and took refuge in a swamp
at Pocasset, although the intelligence service of the English,
through their failure to use native scouts, was so imperfect
that they were unaware of the move of the enemy, and did not
follow up the pursuit. Pocasset was in the territory of Weetamoo,
and the English, by driving Philip into her jurisdiction,
and failing to follow him, practically forced her to join with
him and his warriors.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although, as yet, in spite of their ancient wrongs, the Narragansetts
had shown no hostility, nevertheless, at the instant
when the attack on Philip should have been followed up, the
Massachusetts troops received orders to pass into the Narragansett
country, and to “make peace with a sword in their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>hand.”<a id='r868'></a><a href='#f868' class='c014'><sup>[868]</sup></a> Canonicus, the sachem, could not be found; but the
Massachusetts agents, joined by those from Connecticut,
negotiated a treaty with a few unimportant individuals, who
were forced to obligate the tribe to join the English in making
aggressive war on Philip, and to confirm all former land-grants.<a id='r869'></a><a href='#f869' class='c014'><sup>[869]</sup></a>
The English must have realized, not only that such a treaty
was not binding, but that, so far from gaining the most powerful
of the New England tribes as allies, it would have just the
opposite effect. On the other hand, had the Massachusetts
troops remained with those of Plymouth, and pursued and
captured Philip, the war might possibly have been ended at
once, and the Narragansetts not have entered it at all.</p>

<p class='c001'>Unless we assume the military incapacity of the Massachusetts
Court, we can hardly avoid the suggestion that that
colony, and perhaps Connecticut also, saw an opportunity to
strengthen their claims to the rich lands possessed by the
natives whom they were forcing into opposition, and desired,
by being first on the spot and negotiating the farcical treaty, to
establish a basis for future title. That the mind of Boston
was not bent solely upon the defense of the frontier, or the
devilish effects of periwigs, is suggested by a letter from that
godly town on July 6, which announced that “the land already
gained is worth £10,000.”<a id='r870'></a><a href='#f870' class='c014'><sup>[870]</sup></a> And this in the first fortnight!
The good dames—and their spouses—may be pardoned if
they were tempted toward heresy regarding the fatal results
of curling-tongs and switches.</p>

<p class='c001'>The treaty negotiated, most of the Massachusetts troops
were immediately ordered back to Boston, only about one
hundred, under command of Captain Henchman, being left
with those of Plymouth to guard the swamp in which Philip
had taken refuge. After a skirmish on the 18th, these decided
that it was “ill fighting with a wild beast in his own den,”
and resolved to starve Philip out. That wily savage, however,
gave his cautious watchers the slip, and escaped to central
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>Massachusetts, with his followers. Again owing to inadequate
scouting, it was only after some days that the English found
that they were guarding an empty trap, and then their pursuit
had been too long delayed to be successful.<a id='r871'></a><a href='#f871' class='c014'><sup>[871]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Philip's presence decided the Massachusetts Indians, with
whom the colonial authorities were then negotiating. Captains
Wheeler and Hutchinson, with a small party of whites
and three Christian Indians, who were sent to treat with the
Nipmucks, were treacherously attacked near the place the
savages had appointed for a parley, and about one third of
the colonists were slain. The survivors fled to Brookfield,
gaining that place in safety only with the help of the Christian
Indians, who had warned them of the treachery in advance,
without avail.<a id='r872'></a><a href='#f872' class='c014'><sup>[872]</sup></a> The town was attacked by the natives almost
before the whites could reach it, all the buildings being burned
except the one in which the inhabitants had taken refuge.
After the inmates, for three days, had warded off the efforts
of several hundred savages to set fire to the house which was
their only protection, they were rescued by Major Willard
and a troop from Lancaster, although the town had to be
abandoned.<a id='r873'></a><a href='#f873' class='c014'><sup>[873]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Springfield Indians now joined the enemy, and Connecticut
and Massachusetts troops were concentrated at Hadley,
under command of Major Pynchon. On the first of September,
Deerfield was attacked for the first time, and most of the
houses burned.<a id='r874'></a><a href='#f874' class='c014'><sup>[874]</sup></a> The following day the savages fell upon
Northfield, killed eight persons, and destroyed the buildings.<a id='r875'></a><a href='#f875' class='c014'><sup>[875]</sup></a>
A relief party, under Captain Beers, which, unaware of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>disaster, was bringing up supplies, was ambushed, and twenty
men out of the thirty were killed after a desperate fight, the
remainder taking refuge at Hadley, as did also the inhabitants
of Northfield, who now abandoned their town.<a id='r876'></a><a href='#f876' class='c014'><sup>[876]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Heretofore, in the Massachusetts operations, Major Treat
had been in command of the Connecticut forces, and Major
Pynchon of those from the Bay Colony, Treat's instructions
having been to advise with Pynchon but to act with him only
when convinced of the wisdom of a move.<a id='r877'></a><a href='#f877' class='c014'><sup>[877]</sup></a> Massachusetts
now decided to abandon the field, and merely to garrison the
towns; but this supine policy, which could not have been
permanent, and was a virtual admission of defeat, did not
satisfy Connecticut. As a result of negotiations, the United
Colonies decided to raise the total number of troops to one
thousand, and to put Pynchon in supreme command in the
upper Connecticut Valley. The Commissioners confessed that
they did not know how many troops were already in the field,
or anything of the strength of the enemy.<a id='r878'></a><a href='#f878' class='c014'><sup>[878]</sup></a> This lack of information
was characteristic both in the major conduct of the
war and in minor operations.</p>

<p class='c001'>Only a few days after these arrangements were made, Deerfield
had been attacked again, and Captain Lathrop, with
about sixty men, “the very flower of the county of Essex,”
was detailed to convoy some provisions accumulated there
into Hadley. Although these troops were operating in a country
filled with hostile savages, and the line of march lay in
part through a dense forest, where they might easily be ambushed,
the company had no scouts ahead, and many of the
soldiers had stowed their arms in the carts, while they themselves
gathered grapes by the roadside. Lathrop was familiar
with the road and its dangerous places; but it was at one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>of these, the spot where the trail crossed the little stream
ever since known as Bloody Brook, that the troop encountered
the fatal result of their criminal folly. As they were crossing
the ford, with their heavy wagons lumbering in the mud, the
Indian war-whoop rang out on all sides, and the soldiers fell
under the bullets of their unseen foe. The massacre was
virtually complete. Hardly a man escaped, and not one
would have done so, had not Colonel Moseley with another
small troop, heard the shooting and hurried to the rescue.
He, in turn, was being forced back, and was facing annihilation,
when Major Treat, having likewise heard firing, hastened
up with some Connecticut troops and friendly Indians, and
saved the day.<a id='r879'></a><a href='#f879' class='c014'><sup>[879]</sup></a> The survivors, however, who fell back upon
Deerfield, were obliged to evacuate the town a few days later,
it thus being the third surrendered to the enemy.</p>

<p class='c001'>On September 26, a slight attack was made upon Springfield,
followed by demonstrations against Hadley. Some
troops having been hurried thither from Springfield, the
Indians, successful in their ruse, if that had been their plan,
returned and attacked that town in force, destroying it on
October 5.<a id='r880'></a><a href='#f880' class='c014'><sup>[880]</sup></a> Major Appleton now replaced Pynchon as commander;
but Treat having retired with part of his troops to
Connecticut, in view of the danger threatening Hartford, his
lieutenant refused to obey Appleton, as he considered Treat
to be his immediate superior. The matter became a subject
of dispute between the colonies, but, the danger to Connecticut
having passed, Treat returned, and Connecticut troops continued
to garrison the Massachusetts towns throughout the
winter.<a id='r881'></a><a href='#f881' class='c014'><sup>[881]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Connecticut from the start had adopted the policy of utilizing
to the full the services of the friendly Indians, which Massachusetts,
for the most part had refused, with disastrous consequences.
Not only had she failed to make use of them as
scouts and troops, but by removing the Praying Indians
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>from the line of towns in which they had been settled, and
placing them in a concentration camp on Deer Island, she had
weakened her whole line of defense.<a id='r882'></a><a href='#f882' class='c014'><sup>[882]</sup></a> But, unfortunately, it
was not a question of merely failing to utilize valuable resources.
Her treatment of her civilized natives, individually
and collectively, must be considered as cruel and inhumane,
although the ministers and the magistrates seem, on the whole,
to have endeavored to restrain the lawless persecution of the
mob, and the savagery of their more brutal leaders, such as
Moseley. Innocent Indians were insulted, and plundered
of their possessions, and, in some cases, their women and
children were murdered in cold blood. Yet juries refused
to convict the offenders, and the General Court frequently
yielded to the clamor, until letters from England, and the
discovery of a hideous plot by the whites to massacre all the
converts gathered on Deer Island, awoke them to some sense
of their duty. The blind fury against the Praying Indians
was by no means confined to the rabble. Moseley, whose
refusal to use their services in the war had cost many English
lives, treated them at Marlborough and Nashobeh with the
most wanton brutality, although the execution of a squaw,
taken prisoner on his expedition near Hatfield, is, we hope,
unique in American military history. The laconic note of
her fate merely reads that she was “ordered to be torn in
peeces by Doggs, and she was soe dealt withal.”<a id='r883'></a><a href='#f883' class='c014'><sup>[883]</sup></a> It recalls,
however, the earlier advice of Massachusetts, that the Indians
be hunted down with mastiffs.<a id='r884'></a><a href='#f884' class='c014'><sup>[884]</sup></a> Although he was censured
for his various acts of inhumanity and insubordination, no
action was taken against Moseley by the authorities, who thus
share his guilt; and so high did the feeling run that it became
dangerous, even in Boston, for such men as Eliot and Gookin
to speak a word in defense of the persecuted Christian natives.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the early winter, it seemed as if the enemy had been
successful everywhere. Philip, who apparently had not been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>present in any of the fights, had gone into winter quarters
near Albany,<a id='r885'></a><a href='#f885' class='c014'><sup>[885]</sup></a> but it is probable that the war had long since
passed out of his control; and there is nothing to indicate any
concerted plan governing the actions of the various tribes now,
or soon to be, on the war-path. By far the most powerful
of those surviving were the Narragansetts; and their Sachem
Canonchet, the son of Miantonomo, both from his position and
his ability, was probably a more important factor than Philip;
although, as yet, in spite of the ancient wrong done him in the
judicial murder of his father, and the recent act of the English
in forcing the treaty of July 15 upon some of his people,
the sachem had committed no overt act against the settlers.
A number of hostile Indians, however, had fled to his country
for refuge; and in October, either from a deliberate purpose
to provoke him into active hostility, or in the vain hope that
he would be forced into an alliance with them by threats, the
Massachusetts authorities required him to sign a treaty ratifying
the one of July 15, and agreeing to give up all refugees to
the English.<a id='r886'></a><a href='#f886' class='c014'><sup>[886]</sup></a> It is doubtful whether the sentiment of his
people would have permitted this surrender; but, in any case,
little opportunity was given to test it, and on November 2,
only two weeks after having forced Canonchet to sign a
humiliating peace, the English abruptly declared war.<a id='r887'></a><a href='#f887' class='c014'><sup>[887]</sup></a> Old
Uncas, who had hated the Narragansetts for a lifetime, had
long been scheming to bring about the conflict, and the land
possessed by Canonchet and the refugee Awashonks was a most
potent argument. A journal-letter from a citizen of Boston,
dated only a few days after the treaty with the Narragansett,
complains of his not having delivered up the squaw-sachem,
but that there was prospect of force being used, and that, if
she could be captured, “her Lands will more than pay all
the charge we have been at in this unhappy War.”<a id='r888'></a><a href='#f888' class='c014'><sup>[888]</sup></a> About
a week after the date of this letter, the Commissioners of the
United Colonies, at the same meeting at which war was declared,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>arranged for a levy of a thousand more troops, and an
immediate expedition was planned against the Narragansetts,
under command of Governor Winslow of Plymouth.<a id='r889'></a><a href='#f889' class='c014'><sup>[889]</sup></a> The
Massachusetts Council, with an eye to the long-coveted country,
proclaimed that, if her soldiers “played the man,” and
drove the Narragansetts out of it, the army should receive
allotments of the land in addition to their pay.<a id='r890'></a><a href='#f890' class='c014'><sup>[890]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The various units of the new force, after sundry isolated
skirmishes with the enemy, finally united at Pettisquamscott,
late in the afternoon of December 18, and lay in the open that
night in a severe snowstorm. The Indians, between three and
four thousand in number, had taken refuge in a fortified
position, on an island of four or five acres, in the middle of a
large swamp, about sixteen miles from the English camp.
Before daybreak, on the morning of the 19th, the army began
its march, reaching the swamp about one in the afternoon.
Some of the enemy were encountered upon its edge, but immediately
fled, pursued, without order, by the English, straight
to the entrance of the native fort. For three hours the fighting
was desperate, and it was only after darkness began to fall
that the colonists succeeded in capturing the Indians' blockhouse
and other works. Then came the same order which
had been issued in the Pequot swamp fight thirty years earlier,
and the torch was applied to the four hundred wigwams and
accumulated stores of the savages. It is impossible to tell how
many of the warriors fell in the fight, or how many of the old
people, women, and children were roasted alive in the flames;
but the contemporary estimates run from four hundred to a
thousand or more. The English loss was about seventy killed
and a hundred and fifty wounded.<a id='r891'></a><a href='#f891' class='c014'><sup>[891]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Although the Narragansetts had received a terrible blow,
they had not been so nearly annihilated as had the Pequots
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>in the preceding generation; and the English, in view of their
own actions, could now look for nothing less than a war to
the death, waged with a ferocity equal at least to their own.
An immediate levy of a thousand additional men was arranged
for, divided among the colonies, and a new expedition was
sent into the Nipmuck country, where the Narragansetts had
joined some of Philip's forces.<a id='r892'></a><a href='#f892' class='c014'><sup>[892]</sup></a> The commissariat broke down,
and the short campaign, known as “the hungry march,” accomplished
nothing. On February 10, the savages fell upon
Lancaster and nearly destroyed the town. Within the next
few weeks, attacks were made upon such widely separated
points as Medfield, Northampton, Hatfield, Providence, Groton,
Longmeadow, and Marlborough.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Indians, however, had suffered severely during the
winter from want of food, and, as spring came on, Canonchet
realized that crops must be raised during the summer if the
war were to be maintained. He proposed that the conquered
lands in the Connecticut Valley be planted, and he himself,
with a small party, volunteered to go back to Seakonk, near
Mount Hope, to procure seed-corn. The venture cost him
his life, for he was taken captive by a party of Connecticut
men and Indians operating in the Narragansett country, and
was immediately condemned to death. When told of the
sentence, the savage, who possessed to the full the courage
lacked by Philip, replied that “he liked it well that he should
die before his heart was soft, or had spoken anything unworthy
of himself.”<a id='r893'></a><a href='#f893' class='c014'><sup>[893]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In spite of further attacks by the Indians, one as near Boston
as Sudbury, the tide now turned in favor of the English throughout
southern New England. A heavy blow was struck at
the Upper Falls of the Connecticut, where a great company of
natives had gathered to fish, and where Captain Turner inflicted
a severe defeat upon them, in spite of his own heavy
losses. The privations of the winter, the prospect of semi-starvation
to come, the loss of Canonchet, and the breakdown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>of Philip as a leader, rapidly sapped the morale of the natives,
who became disorganized and demoralized. Detachments of
English hunted down and slaughtered or captured the scattered
bands of savages. Philip, who had returned to his old home
near Mount Hope, narrowly escaped being taken early in
August, his wife and son falling into the hands of the English.
A few weeks later, he himself was slain in a swamp, by one of
Captain Church's Indians, and the main phase of the war,
which, by bearing his name, has unduly exalted his part in it,
was over.<a id='r894'></a><a href='#f894' class='c014'><sup>[894]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Hostilities, however, continued in the eastern settlements
of Maine and New Hampshire for two years longer. Owing
to their scattered character, and the difficulty of inflicting any
telling blow upon the savages, who could disappear into the
limitless forests, and were supplied by the French with arms
and other necessities, Maine suffered proportionately even
more severely than its more populous neighbors to the south.
The story of the war there is the record of tragedy after tragedy
enacted in lonely farmhouse or isolated village. One episode
only, and that because of its later effect upon the Indian
relations of the settlers, need be alluded to. In the autumn
of 1676, following the signing of a treaty in July and a proclamation
by the Massachusetts Court, several hundred natives
congregated at Major Waldron's house at Dover, with the
intention, apparently, of accepting terms of amnesty, and of
testifying to their friendly relations with the whites although
there were some who had borne arms against them. Unexpectedly,
they were all taken into custody by Massachusetts
agents and carried off to Boston, and a large proportion of
them was sold into slavery in the West Indies. There are
various versions of the affair, and it is impossible to unravel
the truth, but, whether rightly or not, the eastern Indians
felt that they had been treacherously dealt with, and never
forgot or forgave the transaction.<a id='r895'></a><a href='#f895' class='c014'><sup>[895]</sup></a> Massachusetts, moreover,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>was unable to protect the eastern settlements; and the treaty
finally made with the Indians, in the spring of 1678, carried
the humiliating condition that the whites were to pay an
annual tribute to the natives.<a id='r896'></a><a href='#f896' class='c014'><sup>[896]</sup></a> The unfortunate result of
the war in that section was that the Indians felt themselves
superior to the whites in power, and they had come to believe
that the word of the latter could not be trusted.</p>

<p class='c001'>The captives taken in Philip's War were variously treated.
Some, who were considered especially guilty, were killed, and
great numbers were distributed among the whites as servants
for a limited period. Many were sold into slavery in the West
Indies.<a id='r897'></a><a href='#f897' class='c014'><sup>[897]</sup></a> Among these unfortunates were the wife and son of
Philip, the latter a little lad of nine.<a id='r898'></a><a href='#f898' class='c014'><sup>[898]</sup></a> Even the life of this
grandson of Massasoit hung in the balance, and the clergy,
to whom the problem of his disposal was referred, advised
that he should be slain; but, as usual, the people were more
merciful than the ministers. Although even the Old Testament
offered difficulties in the way of precedents, John Cotton and
Increase Mather thought that they might be found, and called
for the lad's blood,<a id='r899'></a><a href='#f899' class='c014'><sup>[899]</sup></a> Mather pointing out that, although David
indeed spared the life of little Hadad, it might have been better
had he not. The saintly Eliot, who throughout the war
had pleaded with the people of Massachusetts for justice and
mercy for the Christian Indians, as Williams had pleaded for
the Pequots a generation before, protested against the whole
system of selling off the natives, and in a letter to the Governor
and Council uttered the prophetic saying that “to sell
soules for mony seemeth to me a dangerous merchandize.”<a id='r900'></a><a href='#f900' class='c014'><sup>[900]</sup></a>
But his voice, like Williams's, found no echo.</p>

<p class='c001'>The losses that the colonies had suffered were enormous.
Maine did not recover for half a century, and there was not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>a white man left in Kennebec County. In Massachusetts
sixteen towns were wholly destroyed or abandoned, and four
in Rhode Island.<a id='r901'></a><a href='#f901' class='c014'><sup>[901]</sup></a> Along the entire New England frontier
burned buildings and abandoned farms bore mute witness to
the fury of the struggle. Plymouth reported her war expenses
as £11,743, Connecticut hers as £22,173, and Massachusetts
hers as £46,292, a total equivalent to-day of over $2,000,000.<a id='r902'></a><a href='#f902' class='c014'><sup>[902]</sup></a>
One man out of every sixteen of military age had been killed.
The struggle, however, had been inevitable, and it is fortunate
that it occurred when it did; for it is improbable that the
colonies could have sustained a double attack from south and
north had the domestic contest coincided with the French
war fifteen years later. Although they had been weakened in
some respects, their losses were only temporary, while the
removal of the Indian menace within their borders was a
permanent gain. The ruined towns were rebuilt, new lands
were opened up, and the fact that, entirely by their own
efforts and without aid from England, the colonists had won
possession of their territory with the unlimited expenditure
of their own blood and treasure was of no little effect, then and
later.</p>

disproved by the additional statistics of 13,000 families and 16,000 effectives given in the

<p class='c008'>The year 1676 was doubly noteworthy in the history of New
England. As we have seen in the preceding chapter, it marked
the definite end of the internal menace of the Indians in the
colonies, which henceforth, except for border wars, could
develop their life without that lurking fear of the savage
that had always haunted the dwellers in such little towns as
were planted beyond the area of compact settlement. If, on
the one hand, the year thus seemed to open an era of an even
more unrestricted development for the peculiar polity of
New England, on the other, it also marked the beginning of
a more determined effort on the part of the mother-country
to exert her power over the colonies, and to bring them within
the administrative scope of a better organized empire. The
resultant contest, the earlier phases of which have already
been described, was, in the main, carried on between Massachusetts
and the Crown, and continued intermittently during
the quarter of a century from the Restoration of the Stuarts
to the inevitable loss of the colony's charter in 1684. In a less
critical day, it was wont to be described as an unmitigated
struggle between liberty-loving colonists fighting for freedom,
and a king bent solely upon wreaking his tyrannical will.
But the door of the past is not to be unlocked with so crude
a key, and historians have learned to distrust simple formulas.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the domestic affairs of England, the question that was
more and more urgently pressing for solution was that of the
location of sovereignty, and the source of power. Following
the Reformation, with the development of the modern nationalities,
the establishment of state-churches, and the growth
of dissent, the sixteenth century had witnessed the transfer
of allegiance from ecclesiastical to civil authority. The idea
of law, however, as non-moral and as derived from sanctions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>other than divine, was but slowly coming into being. The
theory of the divine right of a king to rule, although it might
be used to further the purposes of a self-seeking monarch, had
not been originated to serve that end. It was a natural and
necessary stage in the transfer of authoritative sanction from
the Papacy to the civil rulers. It was, in a word, “the assertion
that civil society has an inherent right to exist apart from
its ecclesiastical utility,” and that it has a sanctity of its own,
which may be set off against the claims of the theocrats.<a id='r903'></a><a href='#f903' class='c014'><sup>[903]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>If we would understand the expression of a political idea,
it is as essential to study it in relation to the previous one which
it was brought forth to contradict, as it is to analyze it philosophically.
From the first standpoint, the doctrine of the divine
right of kings performed a useful bit of service, while, philosophically,
it is neither more nor less legitimate than that of the
divine right of a majority. Liberty is not, as our forefathers
were too often told, a natural fact. The only natural liberty
is that granted to the individual, human or brute, to sustain
his life and propagate his species if he can, in the face of a
universe almost overwhelmingly bent upon their destruction.
Civil liberty, on the other hand, is purely social, and is a very
delicate and varying adjustment of rights and duties in the
succeeding stages of man's institutional development, which
has risen and fallen in the past as that equilibrium has been
disturbed. The divine right of kings was a protest against
the divine right of the Pope. The divine right of a majority
is a protest against the divine right of kings; but democracy
has yet to prove whether it is any more capable than theocracy
or monarchy of the sustained moral effort necessary to maintain
the balance between rights and duties, so as to preserve
and enlarge the liberty of the individual.</p>

<p class='c001'>Aside from this question of divine right, there was a good
deal to be said for the theory of sovereignty held by the later
Stuarts, who possessed not only the legal, but the recognized,
right to summon and dissolve Parliament, to create enough
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>peers, lay and spiritual, and to charter enough boroughs, to
alter completely the composition of both the Houses. With
such a relationship, they may well have considered their Parliaments
as but emanations of their own power. There is,
however, even more to be admitted as to their later colonial
policy. For while, in their domestic struggle with Parliament,
they were setting themselves in opposition to almost
all the progressive influences of the times, in their colonial
plans, they were furthering some of the most important. The
reign of Charles II may be taken to mark the end of religion
and the beginning of commerce as the prime influence in
national politics and international relations. From 1672, when
Protestant England joined with Catholic France to crush Protestant
Holland, until 1815, the wars of England were wars
for trade; and the long duel for empire between that country
and France was to make the imperial question essentially one
of trade and defense. It was becoming more and more evident,
indeed, that the seventeenth-century empire rested, fundamentally,
upon trade; and it is probable that the pressure
exerted by the merchant class was quite as large an element
in shaping policy as was any personal design of the King.</p>

<p class='c001'>The beginnings of settlement, scattered and unimportant,
had in no way presaged the empire which was to develop
within a half-century, and not only had territory been granted
away recklessly, but the monarchs had been equally heedless
of the future in the forms of government which they had permitted
to grow up. By the time our story has now reached,
the colonial problem, aside from any question of tyranny, undoubtedly
called for new treatment. If the Empire were
not to be a source of great military weakness, and if the Navigation
Acts, upon which its commercial power rested, were
to be properly enforced, it was obvious that a much greater
degree of administrative unity and control would have to be
realized. In particular, the granting of the charters, in which
no provision had been made for a royal governor or for any
definite channel of communication between the imperial government
and the colony, had undoubtedly been a serious administrative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>blunder, which the attitude of Massachusetts had
made at once worse and more obvious.</p>

<p class='c001'>Indeed, just at a time when a strong administrative control
was most necessary, it may well have appeared as if the Empire
were drifting toward disruption. However different the
material for colonization may have been in the various colonies,—and,
in the main, it is now considered as more uniform than
was formerly thought to have been the case,—the frontier
influence was at work in them all; and the main characteristic
which they possessed in common was their insistence upon
the right of self-government. Not only among the continental
colonies, but among the island ones as well, we find the same
spirit from the start, and the same reiterated demand for
assemblies and self-taxation. The story varies only in detail,
whether we study Tobago, Trinidad, Antigua, Nevis, Jamaica,
Barbadoes, Bermuda, or New England.<a id='r904'></a><a href='#f904' class='c014'><sup>[904]</sup></a> These two points
were wholly compatible with a well-organized empire, however,
and England, for the most part, made no effort to interfere
with either.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was a different matter when the colonies declined to admit
that the imperial government possessed any authority over
them, or refused to observe those laws made for the regulation
of the Empire as a whole. The case of Massachusetts had
become notorious, not only throughout the Empire, but even
among foreigners; and Colbert's agent in the French West
Indies could write that “the English who dwell near Boston
will not worry themselves about the prohibitions which the
King of England may issue, because they hardly recognize his
authority.”<a id='r905'></a><a href='#f905' class='c014'><sup>[905]</sup></a> Although, with reference to Virginia, it was reported
that this “New England disease is very catching,”<a id='r906'></a><a href='#f906' class='c014'><sup>[906]</sup></a> it
seems to have been indigenous in the soil of most of the colonies.
It had long since been reported that many in Barbadoes
wished to become independent “and not run any fortune with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>England either in peace or war,” but to erect their “little limb
of the Commonwealth into a free state.”<a id='r907'></a><a href='#f907' class='c014'><sup>[907]</sup></a> In the very year
in which Massachusetts lost her charter, the inhabitants of
Bermuda were proclaiming that “we are free-born people, our
Lands are our own, and wee will doe with our own what wee
please, and if wee doe not like of the King's Government wee
can desert the Country.”<a id='r908'></a><a href='#f908' class='c014'><sup>[908]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Aside from the influence of the frontier, however, the element
of time was also beginning to make itself felt. In New England,
practically the entire first generation of settlers had died
by the end of Philip's War. The “freemen” who were now
guiding her destinies had, for the most part, been born in the
settlements, and were colonials, in the strict sense of the word.
They possessed no fond memories of the mother-country,
or close personal ties with individuals there. Their interests
and outlook were provincial and local to a degree that we can
hardly realize. They were caught in a little back-water, and
the great current of English life was sweeping on with but
slight influence upon them. The first planters had been drawn
to a large extent from a very sound element in the England
of their day, but, with few exceptions, they were men of narrow
outlook, which had naturally become still narrower in their
laborious, isolated life in America. Among the religious elements
in the new communities, the intensity of their faith
in the divine nature of their mission, combined with their
extraordinary self-consciousness, tended to breed a belief in
their own superiority, which infected not only the whole of
New England, but much subsequent historical writing.
Stoughton's preaching that “God sifted a whole nation that
he might send choice grain over into this wilderness” was but
a mild expression of what the New Englanders thoroughly
believed and loved to be told.<a id='r909'></a><a href='#f909' class='c014'><sup>[909]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>We have already expressed our high appreciation of the
character of much of the early immigration to that section of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>the country; but it cannot be claimed that it included any of
the real leaders in England in any line of thought or action;
and figures which loom large against the background of the
wilderness change their proportions materially when measured
by the national life in the old country. It has been claimed
that Cromwell, at one time, thought seriously of emigrating
to New England; and it is illuminating to consider, had he
done so, the resultant comparative stature, in view of the new
standard of measure thus introduced, of such men as Bradstreet
and Stoughton. The New England leaders were, indeed,
of a more intellectual type generally than came to the
other colonies, and there was, perhaps, more play of mind
among the people than in either the southern continental
or the island settlements. Common-school education was
fostered to a degree unknown elsewhere at the time, and the
village school, with the town-meeting and the Congregational
church, soon took its place in New England's typical community
life. In 1647, Massachusetts passed a law requiring
every town of fifty families to maintain a teacher of reading
and writing, and each town of one hundred families to establish
a grammar school.<a id='r910'></a><a href='#f910' class='c014'><sup>[910]</sup></a> Every town in Connecticut had
its provision for elementary education, and each county its
Latin school. Even Plymouth, in spite of its poverty, was
also fairly well provided.<a id='r911'></a><a href='#f911' class='c014'><sup>[911]</sup></a> In Harvard, which was founded
as early as 1636, the colonies long possessed the only English
institution of higher learning in the new world, although there
was a French college in Quebec, founded at virtually the same
time as Harvard.<a id='r912'></a><a href='#f912' class='c014'><sup>[912]</sup></a> The early Virginia settlers were, at first,
indeed, as solicitous as the New Englanders about education,
but the results of the geographic environment were felt as
strongly in this as in the other matters on which we have
already touched. With the bad roads and the scattered life
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>of the plantations, it was impossible for the common school
to take root as it did in the compact little villages of New
England. But if the common schooling was somewhat less
diffused, the culture of the educated class was wider, and the
private libraries of the Virginians offer to the booklover a refreshing
contrast to the dead weight of theology on the New
England shelves. Nor were these southern libraries confined,
as used to be thought, to a few families, research tending constantly
to minimize the supposed difference between New
England and the rest of the colonies in this regard.<a id='r913'></a><a href='#f913' class='c014'><sup>[913]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Moreover, although her devotion to education was to bear
noble fruit in the years to come, and is one of the chief
contributions of New England to our national life, its original
object, and almost the sole use to which it was put, was
religious, and it may be questioned whether its earlier influence
upon the people at large was not narrowing rather than
broadening. For, in the absence, for the average citizen in
New England, of almost any books other than theological,
and of any intellectual stimulus other than the sermon, the
earlier result of such education as the people received seems
to have been mainly an intensified preoccupation with the
problems of Calvinism, and a remarkable extension of the influence
of the priesthood. The attitude of Massachusetts, in
extirpating so far as possible all ideas opposed to her official
theology, in banishing those who persisted in giving expression
to them, and in exercising a strict censorship over the only
printing-press in New England, nullified, to a great extent,
the benefits that might otherwise have been derived from her
“educational” system in the sense of schools.<a id='r914'></a><a href='#f914' class='c014'><sup>[914]</sup></a> In the writings
of the men who settled Massachusetts or visited it in the earliest
period, there is a freshness and charm of outlook and phrase
which allures the reader even of to-day. In Smith or Bradford,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>Higginson or Wood, one feels in the presence of a healthy
mind, actively interested in this world or the next; but when
these men have passed, the balance of the century leaves us
hardly a work which, for a modern reader, possesses any interest
other than antiquarian or historical.</p>

<p class='c001'>In England, men's minds had been profoundly stirred by
the great parliamentary struggle, the Civil War, and all the
influences of the new period. In science, Ray was founding
systematic zoölogy, Harvey had discovered the circulation of
the blood, Newton the law of gravitation, Boyle the law of
gases which bears his name, and Halley was working in his
observatory at Greenwich. Among the numerous contemporary
writers whom our educated colonists might have been
reading had they been in England, we may mention, at hazard,
Locke, Hobbes, Butler, Marvell, Sir Thomas Browne, Milton,
Taylor, Izaak Walton, Bunyan, Fuller, Clarendon, Herbert,
Dryden, and Herrick. But of all this varied intellectual
life, it may be said that practically nothing reached the vast
majority of New Englanders, whose science was still made
up of the superstitious observances of “special providences,”
and whose political life was centred in the meeting of church
or town. If they felt the need of verse, they read Uriah
Oakes or Michael Wigglesworth, and the need must have
been as great as its reward was inadequate. Of other printed
literature indigenous to the soil, there was practically none
except theological, and the few historical accounts brought out
by the Indian wars.<a id='r915'></a><a href='#f915' class='c014'><sup>[915]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Such impoverishment of the intellectual life was a necessary
consequence of living in the wilderness in the seventeenth
century; but it was none the less a misfortune because inevitable.
In New England, however, a peculiar result ensued
from the combination of the extreme rarity of the intellectual
atmosphere and the partial education of her people. In the
other colonies, men may have been more ignorant of books,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>but they were healthy-minded. In New England, the concentration
of an awakened mental life almost wholly upon the
problems of election or damnation created a condition of
ethical morbidity, and bequeathed to us the legacy of what
may almost be called that section's fourth contribution to
American life—the New England conscience, with its pathological
questionings and elaborate system of taboos. It is an
interesting psychological study, not without its immediate
historical bearings, to contrast the diaries of such English
officials as Pepys or Evelyn with that kept by the active
Massachusetts official, Sewall, who could amuse himself all
Christmas Day arranging the coffins in the family vault, and
pronounce the occupation to have been “an awfull yet pleasing
Treat.”<a id='r916'></a><a href='#f916' class='c014'><sup>[916]</sup></a> Toward the end of the seventeenth century, public
opinion in New England, economic, religious, political, and
social, had grown largely out of touch with that in the old
country; but the nature of the case demanded that, in the
last analysis, the government of the Empire must be mainly
determined by the latter and not by the former.</p>

<p class='c001'>As in England, however, parties based on civil differences
were replacing the old religious ones, so in New England,
parties were forming due to the rise of altered economic conditions,
and the passing of the early religious spirit. We have
already noted the presence in Massachusetts, from the start,
of a considerable body of dissent from the doctrine and polity
of the colonial state church, and the decline in fervor even
within the group of the Saints themselves. Men who, according
to the official church theory, were not of the elect, and yet
who were conscious of trying to live helpful, honest, God-fearing
lives, refused to acknowledge the truth of the denunciations
which, under penalty of fine, they were forced to listen
to, Sunday after Sunday, hurled at themselves by the leading
divines. Hooker might thunder that “no carrion in a ditch
smells more loathsomely in the nostrils of man, than a natural
man's works do in the nostrils of the Almighty”; or Shepard
declare that the mind of the natural man “is a nest of all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>foul opinions, heresies, that ever were vented,” and his heart
“a foul sink all of atheism, sodomy, blasphemy, murder,
whoredom, adultery, witchcraft, buggery.”<a id='r917'></a><a href='#f917' class='c014'><sup>[917]</sup></a> The bow had
been bent too long, and had lost its spring. Bradstreet might
still demand that “the old stand firm” against “that cursed
Bratt Toleration,” but Bishop reported more truly “that many
are gospel-glutted and growing weary.”<a id='r918'></a><a href='#f918' class='c014'><sup>[918]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>At the time when religion was thus gradually passing as the
leading cause of division in New England, other forces were at
work to align the citizens into new parties. In a former
chapter, we called attention to the early beginning, on a small
scale, of the divergence between the life of the frontiers and
that of the older and more established settlements. With the
growth of a few of the larger centres, notably Boston, there
also developed the conflict of economic interests and political
outlook between town and country.<a id='r919'></a><a href='#f919' class='c014'><sup>[919]</sup></a> The prosperity of the
Empire under the Navigation Acts had increased enormously,
and New England, although refusing to obey the laws, had
shared to the full in the resultant growth of trade and wealth.
From all these causes, there had developed fairly distinct
opposing groups—a large element of liberals in theology,
as against the maintainers of rigid orthodoxy; a conservative
“east” against a radical “west,” a progressive urban population,
contrasted with the more narrow-minded, unchanging
rural laborers and farmers; and a trading, moneyed class,
with views and interests differing from the agricultural.<a id='r920'></a><a href='#f920' class='c014'><sup>[920]</sup></a> The
distinctions are real and marked, though the numbers of those
in the various parties, and their exact groupings on special
questions, can only be approximated. The magistrates, consisting,
for the most part, of men of wealth and position chosen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>from the larger centres, and the deputies, resident in each of
the towns from which they were elected, represented, in their
differing attitudes, the moderate and radical opinion of the
colonies as a whole. In the relations with England, those who
were liberal in theology, in closer personal or commercial
contact with the old country, and more conservative in their
outlook, would naturally favor a conciliatory attitude. Those,
on the other hand, who believed that the supreme object at
stake was the maintaining of the peculiar ecclesiastical organization
of their church-state, with its religious franchise tests,
and those who had no direct business relations with England
or other countries, would as naturally tend to adopt an unyielding
attitude of opposition. There is a direct line of descent
from the moderate party of 1676 to the Loyalist party of
1776; and, as the wholesale condemnation of the latter is now
considered uncritical, so, also, we cannot off-hand divide the
parties of the earlier struggle into traitors and patriots.</p>

<p class='c001'>As in old England the main question of the day was the
location of sovereignty, so it was in the New, and in the relations
between the two. The theory of the state as based upon
original contract, which, although implicit in feudalism, was,
as we have seen, probably derived in New England from the
church covenant, had even less historical or philosophical basis
than that of divine right. However, the advances made by
mankind are not less real because they have nearly always been
contemporaneously justified by false assumptions. In such
cases “conclusions are more permanent than premises,” as Mr.
Balfour points out in speaking of “the incongruity between the
causes by which beliefs are sustained, and the official reasons
by which they are from time to time justified.”<a id='r921'></a><a href='#f921' class='c014'><sup>[921]</sup></a> It is in this
very failure of man to reason rightly as to the grounds of his
own efforts that we perceive most clearly the operations of
forces in human history independent of man's own will and
thought, precisely where, for himself, the illusion of a reasoned
freedom is strongest. Although the theories of divine right
and of original compact have now both been discarded among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>the philosophical lumber of the past, the latter theory was of
enormous influence in shaping American political thought.
Before, however, that thought could legitimately give expression
to the dictum, “No taxation without representation,” it
was necessary that the community as a whole, and not a
religious sect, should be considered to be the “people”; and
before Massachusetts could join in declaring that “All men
are created equal,” she had to abandon her earlier politico-religious
distinction between a minority born to be everlasting
saints and a majority doomed to eternal damnation. We
must now turn to consider, more in detail, the story of how
that result was achieved.</p>

<p class='c001'>The heirs of Mason and Gorges had never abandoned their
claims to the territory in New Hampshire and Maine which
had been illegally absorbed by Massachusetts, and, of late,
they had been pressing their respective cases with more and
more insistence. In May, 1675, the law officers of the Crown
reported to the Committee for Foreign Plantations that, in
their opinion, both claims were based upon valid titles.<a id='r922'></a><a href='#f922' class='c014'><sup>[922]</sup></a> It was
not mainly, however, the complaints of these individual
claimants, or Mason's detailed recommendations to send commissioners
to New England,<a id='r923'></a><a href='#f923' class='c014'><sup>[923]</sup></a> which decided the government
to take a more active part in the administration of the colonies.
Peace had been signed with the Dutch in the preceding year,
and the ending of the war provided leisure for undertaking
more seriously the reorganization of colonial administration.
The reform began at home with the abolition of the old Council
Committee, and the placing of colonial affairs in the hands of
a new committee known as the Lords of Trade and Plantations.
Its members were able men, well qualified for their work, and
displayed considerable energy, holding eighty-nine meetings in
the first year after their organization.<a id='r924'></a><a href='#f924' class='c014'><sup>[924]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The New England question promptly came in for a share
of their attention. We have already noted the many and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>constant complaints in regard to Massachusetts, and the
attitude of that colony toward the Royal Commissioners in
1664. While all these old matters, as well as the newly delivered
legal opinions regarding the Mason and Gorges claims,
were before the Lords of Trade, they probably found their
chief ground for dissatisfaction with Massachusetts in her
disregard of the Navigation Acts, and the assumption of
virtual independence. Captain Wyborne of H. M. S. Garland,
after a visit to Boston, reported that New England's
trade to Europe and the West Indies had become very great,
and that the magistrates refused to act regarding violations of
the law, the people looking upon themselves as “a free state.”<a id='r925'></a><a href='#f925' class='c014'><sup>[925]</sup></a>
About six weeks later, twenty-eight English merchants complained
that New England was illegally trading on a great
scale between Europe and the various parts of the British
Empire, and so underselling the English in both markets, and
ruining business.<a id='r926'></a><a href='#f926' class='c014'><sup>[926]</sup></a> New England herself produced none of the
“enumerated commodities,” and, had she confined herself to
legitimate trade, would not have been placed at any appreciable
disadvantage by the Navigation Acts of this period. By
evading the law, however, she gained not only the advantage
of an unrestricted commerce, when such was not allowed in
any of the over-seas empires of the time, but also an extra,
illegitimate profit, over and above her law-abiding competitors,
exactly as a smuggler of dutiable articles makes a larger profit
than the legitimate merchant, solely by virtue of the existence
of the very laws that the former evades. The amount lost
by England on New England's domestic illegal trade was not
great; but, if the rapidly increasing business of those colonies
between Europe and the rest of the Empire were allowed to go
on unchecked, the integrity of the whole imperial structure
would be seriously threatened.<a id='r927'></a><a href='#f927' class='c014'><sup>[927]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>Mason had advised that a new commissioner, or a governor
general, be sent to New England; but the English government
refused, on the ground that it would give needless affront, and
“would look like awarding execution on those people before
they were heard.”<a id='r928'></a><a href='#f928' class='c014'><sup>[928]</sup></a> It was, therefore, decided that Massachusetts
should be asked to send over agents; and, probably
in view of the colony's now well-known policy of delay, it was
determined to transmit the demand by a special messenger,
who should bring back personally the answer of the General
Court. The individual selected for this task was Edward
Randolph, who was instructed, not only to deliver the King's
letter, and receive the reply, but also to make a report on trade
and other conditions in the colony, in order that the government
might have a better basis for intelligent action.<a id='r929'></a><a href='#f929' class='c014'><sup>[929]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Randolph was of the narrow-minded, official type, a stickler
for technicalities, a thorough believer in centralized imperial
control, and easily influenced by prejudice, but possessed of
enormous energy, and of very considerable ability. He had
the not uncommon fault of forcing facts to fit his theories
rather than building theories from the facts; but in his long
connection with the colonies, in offices in which it would have
been peculiarly easy to live by bribes, he was incorruptibly
honest, a rare quality in that day. Moreover, although always
poor, and in his later life embittered, he could yet be generous
toward the distress of others; and when Mason's motherless
children were suffering from poverty in England, he allowed
them £20 a year from his own scanty income.<a id='r930'></a><a href='#f930' class='c014'><sup>[930]</sup></a> While he was
violently opposed to the decentralization of authority involved
in the charter governments, he was not anxious to play the
tyrant, and seems to have believed that the changes he had
at heart would benefit not only the Empire, but the colonists as
well. On more than one occasion, indeed, this “blasted
wretch,” as Mather called him, defended their interests against
the Crown. No English official in our colonial history, however,
was more thoroughly hated, and he returned the feeling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>in so far as the ruling powers of Massachusetts were concerned.
In this he was hardly to be blamed, for their attitude
and policy toward him, from the first, consisted in covert obstruction
and open insult.</p>

<p class='c001'>He arrived in Boston early in June, and at once showed his
credentials, and stated his errand, to Governor Leverett. At
the meeting of the Council, at which the King's letter was presented,
the Governor and all but three magistrates kept their
hats on while the missive was being read, refusing to uncover
according to the usual custom. When the reading was concluded,
Leverett curtly stated that “the matters therein contained
were very inconsiderable things and easily answered,”
although, in reality, it was the most important communication
that the local government had ever received. When Randolph
called their attention to the demand of the King that an answer
be returned, he was simply told that the matter would be considered.<a id='r931'></a><a href='#f931' class='c014'><sup>[931]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Although his instructions were that he should remain a
month, in order to gather the data required before returning,
the Council announced, within two days, that they had an
answer prepared to the royal letter, which they were going to
send immediately, but which they would not entrust to Randolph,
offering him only a copy, despite the King's express
command. When Randolph asked if they could have well considered
so weighty a matter in forty-eight hours, he was curtly
requested to withdraw, unless he had further orders from the
King, as the Councillors looked upon him as Mason's agent.</p>

<p class='c001'>Meanwhile, several ships had arrived direct from various
European ports, contrary to the Navigation Acts, of which Randolph
spoke to the Governor in the course of an interview
on the following day. Leverett thereupon declared that the
laws made by King and Parliament did not apply to Massachusetts,
and that any dispute between England and the
colony was to be decided by the colony and not by England.<a id='r932'></a><a href='#f932' class='c014'><sup>[932]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>Randolph next proceeded into New Hampshire, where he
showed letters from Mason, and naturally received many
complaints from disaffected inhabitants in regard to Massachusetts.
For his actions there, he was sharply rebuked by
Leverett, who accused him of trying to “make a mutiny and
disturbance.” Randolph had also suggested, just before going
to New Hampshire, that the General Court be summoned, in
order to consider the King's dispatch; but this was not done,
and he finally sailed for England with only a copy of the letter
written by the Council.<a id='r933'></a><a href='#f933' class='c014'><sup>[933]</sup></a> In that letter, Leverett wrote, with
considerable effrontery, that the complaints of Mason and
Gorges were “impertinencies, mistakes and falsehoods,” but
said nothing about complying with the demand to send agents,
except that the General Court, which, he claimed, could not
then be summoned on account of sickness and the Indian
War, would be convened later.<a id='r934'></a><a href='#f934' class='c014'><sup>[934]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Owing to the unwise course of the rulers, Randolph could
hardly fail to have been biased by the information received
from their opponents; and the result is evident in the long
report which he submitted to the Lords of Trade on his return.
Although, owing to his preconceived ideas, and the circumstances
of his stay, he misjudged the strength of the opposing
parties in the colony, and although certain of his statistics
were greatly exaggerated, the report, on the whole, gave a detailed
and truthful presentation of the general situation, and
confirmed other information possessed in England.<a id='r935'></a><a href='#f935' class='c014'><sup>[935]</sup></a> For, while
Randolph was on his way west, the Lords of Trade had pursued
their investigations, and summoned before them merchants
trading with New England. Of these, “some were shy to unfold
the mystery, others pretended ignorance, but most declared
plainly” that New England traders were regularly breaking
the law, and that, by their direct trade in European goods
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>with the other colonies they were able to undersell, by twenty
per cent, those doing a legitimate business.<a id='r936'></a><a href='#f936' class='c014'><sup>[936]</sup></a> This was confirmed,
a few weeks later, by an official returned from a trip
to the West Indies, who reported seventeen New England
ships engaged there in a clandestine trade with Europe in log-wood
for dyeing, which not only threatened to involve the
whole Empire in a war with Spain, but provided England's
rivals with cheaper dyes than she herself obtained.<a id='r937'></a><a href='#f937' class='c014'><sup>[937]</sup></a> It was
becoming more and more evident, the deeper the matter was
probed, that the question was not a domestic one for Massachusetts,
whatever she might choose to assume, but one that
involved the interests of England and the Empire.</p>

<p class='c001'>The meeting of the General Court in Massachusetts, to
consider the King's letter, was not held until August, when the
question of complying with the order to send agents to England
was referred for advice to the clergy, as usual. Their opinion
being in favor of obedience, the people's representatives, in the
following month, adopted an address to the King, and appointed
Stoughton and Bulkley as agents.<a id='r938'></a><a href='#f938' class='c014'><sup>[938]</sup></a> The address was
accompanied by a long statement of the claims of Massachusetts
to the disputed eastern territory, which presented her
interpretation of her boundaries, and the benefits to the inhabitants
of her government there, in as favorable a light as
possible, dismissing the claims of Mason and Gorges, adjudged
valid by the Crown lawyers, as “frivolous and insignificant
allegations.”<a id='r939'></a><a href='#f939' class='c014'><sup>[939]</sup></a> The colony still delayed, however, and her
agents did not reach England until January of the following
year. Their position was evidently realized to be an unenviable
one, for the Reverend John Eliot wrote in his diary,
“Mr. Stoughton &#38; mr. Bulkly were sent to England to agent
for the Country. Lord p'ty ym.”<a id='r940'></a><a href='#f940' class='c014'><sup>[940]</sup></a> They were furnished with
two sets of instructions, according to which they were given
authority to act in regard to the Mason-Gorges matters only,
and to plead lack of power as to all others. They were also,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>on the one hand, to represent to the King that the eastern
provinces were of little value, and, on the other, to endeavor
to purchase them from Mason and Gorges, if possible.<a id='r941'></a><a href='#f941' class='c014'><sup>[941]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In limiting her agents to the one matter of the eastern provinces,
Massachusetts was technically complying with the
King's request; but the New England question was much
wider in scope than that, and the unhappy agents soon found
themselves in deep waters. The colony's policy had been
such that the English government could not expect more
from other agents than from those who were then actually
present, who were, after all, primarily English subjects and
not colonial representatives, and who could, therefore, well
be called upon to explain their colony's acts, though they could
not bind her by agreements. Randolph was now busily
engaged in pressing his views on the government, listing the
crimes and misdemeanors of the colony, and outlining a
course of action. While some of his accusations were so exaggerated
as to be palpably false, others were unquestionably
true, such as denying appeals to England, violating the Navigation
Acts, imposing an oath of fidelity to the local government
while refusing the oath of allegiance to England, and
putting English citizens to death for religious opinions.<a id='r942'></a><a href='#f942' class='c014'><sup>[942]</sup></a> He
proposed that the King issue a general pardon for all past
offenses, confirm real-estate titles on payment of a moderate
quit-rent, grant liberty of conscience, and organize the colony
as a royal province.<a id='r943'></a><a href='#f943' class='c014'><sup>[943]</sup></a> Detailed evidence, in reference to the
illegal trading, derived from such widely separated points as
London, Jamaica, and Amsterdam, was also laid before the
Committee.<a id='r944'></a><a href='#f944' class='c014'><sup>[944]</sup></a> All these various allegations, together with the
question of the validity of the charter, and the laws made by
the General Court, were divided into “matters of law” and
“matters of state,” and submitted to the Judges and Privy
Council respectively.<a id='r945'></a><a href='#f945' class='c014'><sup>[945]</sup></a> While the decisions were pending, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>agents were questioned in reference to the complaints against
the colony, and answered as “private men,” admitting some
of the statements, as to coining money and violating the
Navigation Acts, but denying that the Quakers had been put
to death on account of their religion only.<a id='r946'></a><a href='#f946' class='c014'><sup>[946]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The decisions of the judges in regard to the matters submitted
to them were eminently fair. The validity of the
Massachusetts charter was upheld as originally granted, and
it was further stated that the document had created the
patentees a corporation upon the place. The latter opinion,
which was of very doubtful legality, not only decided, in so
far as it went, that the transfer of the charter to New England
had been legal, but also settled in favor of the colony the question
whether or not the <span lang="la"><i>Quo Warranto</i></span> proceedings of 1635 had
in reality dissolved the corporation. In regard to the geographical
limits of the colony, however, the interpretation that
Massachusetts had developed, in order to cover her encroachments,
was declared to be without foundation. But at the
last moment either the agents or the colony's counsel had
themselves retracted the absurd claims, in spite of their recent
statement that those of Gorges and Mason were “frivolous,”
and the earlier characterization of them as impertinent falsehoods.
Those of the former were now sustained in full, both
as to ownership and power of government. Mason was declared
not to have received any legal rights to govern, although
his title to the land north of the Merrimac was pronounced
a valid one. As to the smaller territory in dispute, lying
between that river and Salem, the Attorney-General was of
the opinion that Mason had never taken legal possession, and
that his claim, therefore, was probably not good against the
actual possession by Massachusetts settlers for fifty years; but
that the question would have to be tried in courts upon the
place.<a id='r947'></a><a href='#f947' class='c014'><sup>[947]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In regard to the Massachusetts laws, the Attorney-General
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>properly objected to making capital such offenses “which are
so by the word of God,” it being “suspicious what are so.”
He pointed in particular, also, to such statutes as provided for
the putting to death of stubborn and rebellious children, for
civil marriage, for levying fines for observing Christmas Day,
and laying penalties upon children for playing on Sunday, as
well as those against heresy, and to the lack of provision for
the oath of allegiance.<a id='r948'></a><a href='#f948' class='c014'><sup>[948]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>All these matters were then discussed with the agents, who
were told that Massachusetts must confine herself to her legal
boundaries, that she must ask pardon for having coined money,
prepare to accept a supplementary charter, observe the Navigation
Acts, receive a royal revenue officer, and repeal such
laws as were repugnant to the laws of England. The question
of the colony's assumed right to tax non-freemen and
strangers was also raised. The agents were further told that
they could not return home as yet, as their presence would be
useful; and as for their not having full powers, “his Majesty
did not think of treating with his own subjects as with foreigners.”
The whole course of Massachusetts in reference
to the Royal Commissioners and her own agents, and her assuming
to deal with the home government or not as she
pleased, as if she were in reality independent and sovereign,
had made some such step necessary, unless England was willing
to allow the Empire to disintegrate. The agents were also
sharply reminded that although, twelve years previously, the
colony had been told that it could not retain the exclusive
religious test for the franchise, and a law had been passed
ostensibly granting it to non-church members, yet in reality
the law was disregarded, and virtually only church members
were allowed to vote.</p>

<p class='c001'>To this the agents made a reply so disingenuous as to be
false. They stated that they knew of no such practice, and
that religious opinion was no bar to being elected a freeman,
although the records indicate that only one man who was not
a church member had been given the franchise in the preceding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>eleven years, as compared with eight hundred and
seventy-five who were church members.<a id='r949'></a><a href='#f949' class='c014'><sup>[949]</sup></a> Moreover, only five
years previously, in the legal code of 1672, the law disfranchising
all persons who did not attend the Congregational
church had been reënacted, and, in fact, remained in force
until the forfeiture of the charter.</p>

<p class='c001'>The agents having sent home an account of their mission,
the General Court passed a law requiring obedience to the
Navigation Acts, and, without foundation, stated in a preamble
that the King's desire that the laws be enforced had not
“binn before now signified unto us,” although the colony's
failure to observe them had been one of the main complaints
of the Royal Commissioners in 1665, and in that year, the
Court had promised to obey them and had repealed laws inconsistent
with them.<a id='r950'></a><a href='#f950' class='c014'><sup>[950]</sup></a> The government immediately called
this false statement to the attention of the colony's agents,
who attempted to apologize for it as an “act of precipitation,”
made just as the Court was rising,<a id='r951'></a><a href='#f951' class='c014'><sup>[951]</sup></a> which could hardly improve
the government's opinion of the honesty of the colonial authorities,
or of the attention they were giving to a very serious
situation. As a matter of fact, it is difficult to find excuse
for the statement; for not only were all the earlier proceedings
a matter of record, but of the eleven magistrates who now
declared that the colony had never had any knowledge of the
matter before, nine had been members of the earlier Court,
which had received the complaints, and passed the legislation.
The Court's own communication thus seemed to prove Randolph's
contention, and the evidence from other sources, that
Massachusetts was, in reality, paying no attention to the laws
of trade.</p>

<p class='c001'>No effort was made by the Court to meet the other charges
or requirements, and, so far from enforcing the oath of allegiance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>they passed a new ordinance that any one in the colony,
stranger or resident, who refused to take the local oath of
fidelity, should be deprived of all legal rights and protection.<a id='r952'></a><a href='#f952' class='c014'><sup>[952]</sup></a>
In spite of the failure of the Court to attempt to meet any
of the other points raised by the English government, they petitioned
for an extension of the colony's northern boundary
so as to include the land lying between the Merrimac and the
Piscataqua, and again instructed their agents to buy Maine
from Gorges.<a id='r953'></a><a href='#f953' class='c014'><sup>[953]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Randolph had no difficulty in exposing the misstatements
as to the franchise and the Navigation Acts, and made further
representations to the Lords of Trade. That body was now
thoroughly tired of the attitude and tactics of Massachusetts,
and decided that, so far from granting that colony an extension
of territory, the “whole matter ought to bee considered from
the Very Root.”<a id='r954'></a><a href='#f954' class='c014'><sup>[954]</sup></a> They decided that the colonists both
ignored “fair persuasions” and took no notice of orders, and
that it was evidently impossible, judging presumably from the
statements that were made by both the colonial government and
its agents, to determine whether the laws were being enforced
or not. In view of the facts, some of the Lords were of the
opinion that nothing would solve the problem except the
sending out of a royal governor, who could look after imperial
interests and serve as a real channel of communication between
the colony and the home government. As this could not be
done under the charter, the question was referred to the Attorney-General
whether, if the charter were, indeed, valid,
the violations of its provisions had been sufficient to warrant
its forfeiture.<a id='r955'></a><a href='#f955' class='c014'><sup>[955]</sup></a> His opinion being that the violations were
great enough to justify action, the Lords advised that <span lang="la"><i>Quo
Warranto</i></span> proceedings be instituted, and that Randolph be
appointed Collector of Customs in New England. Shortly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>after, he received the appointment, in spite of the protests
of the agents.<a id='r956'></a><a href='#f956' class='c014'><sup>[956]</sup></a> For the first time there was now to be resident
in the colony an official directly responsible to the imperial,
and not to the local, government. The choice of both office
and person for the introduction of a new system of control
was unfortunate, but the change in the system itself had been
forced by the colony's own rulers.</p>

<p class='c001'>Meanwhile, Massachusetts was doing nothing to render her
position more favorable, and the purchase of Maine, which
the agents had effected privately with Gorges for £1250,
further irritated the government.<a id='r957'></a><a href='#f957' class='c014'><sup>[957]</sup></a> Moreover, although Gorges
could not alienate his rights of government, Massachusetts
proceeded to exercise them in defiance of the royal order, of
her own legal powers, and gradually, it would seem, of the
desires of the inhabitants.<a id='r958'></a><a href='#f958' class='c014'><sup>[958]</sup></a> The disaffection of the Maine
people, who had been fairly contented before, may have been
caused in part by the levying of quit-rents by Massachusetts,
who, on becoming proprietor in place of Gorges, may have
taken this means of reimbursing herself for the £1250 expended;
for the records show that she did exercise such rights,
and considered herself as in receipt of a regular income from
quit-rents in her new province.<a id='r959'></a><a href='#f959' class='c014'><sup>[959]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>To add to the bad odor of New England affairs, the Atherton
Land Company chose this particular juncture to reassert its
claim to the Narragansett country, and that question rose to
the surface again, Holden and Greene, of Rhode Island, making
serious complaints before the Crown of the encroachments of
Massachusetts. Although, so far as Connecticut and the
Bay Colony were concerned, the whole question of the King's
Province had been settled a dozen years previously, they had
both continued to plague their smaller neighbor with their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>claims, and Rhode Island now asked that the King appoint a
“Supreme Court of Judicature” over all the New England
colonies, to settle boundary disputes.<a id='r960'></a><a href='#f960' class='c014'><sup>[960]</sup></a> Although this was not
done, Massachusetts was told to let the province alone,<a id='r961'></a><a href='#f961' class='c014'><sup>[961]</sup></a> and
the whole episode could not fail to impress the English government
more forcibly than ever with the necessity of establishing
a greater degree of local royal control. Soon after, the same
suggestion of a Supreme Court was made in the curious case of
a Connecticut Indian, who had made his way to England to
complain both of fraud against himself and of the general
treatment of his race by the colonists, against whom, he
claimed, it was impossible to secure justice in the colonial
courts.<a id='r962'></a><a href='#f962' class='c014'><sup>[962]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In the fall of 1678, the Massachusetts Court finally agreed
to administer the oath of allegiance, and to pass a law against
treason; but beyond that they refused to go.<a id='r963'></a><a href='#f963' class='c014'><sup>[963]</sup></a> In fact, in their
answer to the Attorney-General regarding their laws, they announced
that the laws of England did “not reach <a id='corr387.18'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>Amerrica</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_387.18'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>Amerrica</ins></a></span>,”
and that, as the colonies were not represented in Parliament,
they were not subject to the Navigation Acts. These, however,
the Court reënacted, in order, according to their theory,
to give them validity within Massachusetts.<a id='r964'></a><a href='#f964' class='c014'><sup>[964]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The doctrine of no taxation without representation is a
natural deduction from the contract theory, and has as little
historical or philosophical justification as has that of the
theoretical contract itself. It is mere commonplace to dwell
on the philosophical weakness of the doctrine, the brief expression
of which was to become the rallying cry of a continent
a century later. From a practical standpoint, however, it
may be pointed out, that what may be called the historical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>basis of representation in England in the seventeenth century
was quite different from the numerical basis in the United
States to-day, and that, in the former sense, the inhabitants
of Massachusetts were as fully represented for purposes of
taxation as were the vast majority of the citizens then resident
in England, except for the unavoidable effects of distance
alluded to in an earlier chapter.<a id='r965'></a><a href='#f965' class='c014'><sup>[965]</sup></a> If, on the other hand, it
be claimed that the colony's government had in mind representation
in the modern American sense, then they were acting
even more tyrannically than was England, for they were themselves,
without any legal right to do so under the charter,
taxing the four fifths of the residents of Massachusetts who
had no voice in the local government, save in exactly the same
vicarious way in which all the colonists were represented in
Parliament. It may also be noted that we, to-day, deny
such representation, as Massachusetts was now claiming, to
our own citizens resident in our territories and colonies. The
theory of direct representation in Parliament of England's
overseas possessions was not a new one, however, nor was it
evolved in America. In the sixteenth century, Calais had
been represented for a short time,<a id='r966'></a><a href='#f966' class='c014'><sup>[966]</sup></a> while Barbadoes had
declared how “impracticable” it was that they should be
taxed when unrepresented in Parliament, five years before the
cry was raised in New England.<a id='r967'></a><a href='#f967' class='c014'><sup>[967]</sup></a> Nor was that cry raised
solely in the cause of freedom. The demand, in reality, was,
not that there should be no taxation without representation,
but that the members of the Congregational church should be
confirmed in their claim to tax the entire community without
interference from England.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>In the letter which the King sent to the colony by its agents,
who, on account of the attention of the government being
entirely absorbed with the Popish Plot, were at last permitted
to leave in June, 1679, he again returned to the question of
religion and the suffrage. He insisted upon toleration for all
except Papists, and a property qualification as the only one
necessary for the franchise.<a id='r968'></a><a href='#f968' class='c014'><sup>[968]</sup></a> He also expressed his displeasure
at the colony's secret purchase of Maine, and directed the
surrender of the title-deeds upon repayment of the price paid.
The colony was also instructed to withdraw all commissions
granted for governing New Hampshire, as the legal right of
administration was vested in the Crown, which was then
considering a new establishment there. Other agents, in place
of those now returning, were ordered to be sent within six
months, duly instructed to act in the necessary regulating of
the colony's affairs.<a id='r969'></a><a href='#f969' class='c014'><sup>[969]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Massachusetts persisted in her old tactics, and it was over
three years before she sent the required agents to England.
Meanwhile, Randolph, during his first year as customs officer,
had met with no assistance, and every possible obstruction,
in the performance of his duties, so that not a single ship had
been seized for irregular trading.<a id='r970'></a><a href='#f970' class='c014'><sup>[970]</sup></a> In the court of February,
1680, the royal instructions were considered, and during the
early part of the year a committee was appointed to revise
the laws, while the New Hampshire commissions were canceled.
The colony, however, proceeded to establish its own government
in Maine, under the presidency of Danforth, despite the
King's commands and a local disturbance at Casco.<a id='r971'></a><a href='#f971' class='c014'><sup>[971]</sup></a> In two
letters to the English Secretary of State, Bradstreet, who had
succeeded Leverett as governor, defended the purchase of the
province, and virtually refused to alter the colony's practice
in the matter of the franchise, except by nominally conceding
that members of the Church of England would not be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>considered heterodox. He held out no prospect of agents
being sent, alleging the poverty of the colony and the danger
of the “Turkish” pirates, who had captured several vessels.<a id='r972'></a><a href='#f972' class='c014'><sup>[972]</sup></a>
In reply, the King wrote, in September, insisting that agents
be sent within three months, with sufficient powers to settle
all outstanding questions, and with such evidences of title
as the colony might claim, to the strip of land in dispute with
Mason.<a id='r973'></a><a href='#f973' class='c014'><sup>[973]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In January, 1681, this letter was read at a special meeting
of the General Court, and Stoughton and Samuel Nowell were
appointed agents. Stoughton evidently had no desire to
repeat his former experiences, and, two months later, John
Richards, a wealthy Boston merchant, was appointed in his
place.<a id='r974'></a><a href='#f974' class='c014'><sup>[974]</sup></a> The months went by, however, and the end of the
year found the agents still in America.</p>

<p class='c001'>The patience of the English government had now become
exhausted. For twenty years, since the Restoration, that government
had been endeavoring, by every means in its power,
to settle the New England question in a way that would be
satisfactory to all the colonists, regardless of creed, and would,
at the same time, permit the maintenance of the trade-system
upon which the Empire was based. Had Massachusetts at
any time been willing to give up her illicit profits, she could
very possibly have saved her charter. The violations of that
instrument upon which final action was taken were as palpable
and actual in 1660 as in 1684. Had the English government
merely wished to overthrow that of Massachusetts, it could
legally have done so at any time it desired; and the prompt
dispatch of a thousand English troops, at the time of Bacon's
rebellion in Virginia, showed that it was capable of vigorous
and effective action, when it was felt to be necessary. But
every evidence points to the fact that it did not wish to be
bothered with the problem in Massachusetts, or to proceed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>strong measures until absolutely forced to do so by the persistent
attitude of the colony, which was virtually seceding
from the Empire.<a id='r975'></a><a href='#f975' class='c014'><sup>[975]</sup></a> The “New England disease” of avowed independence
and nullification was infecting the rest of the Empire,
and undermining England's prestige both within and without.
The colony's increasing illegal trade was threatening the
destruction of the legitimate business of colonial and home merchants
alike, as well as the Empire's international relations.
Although New England's domestic trade was of slight value
to the mother-country, she occupied a strategic position of
first importance in relation to the valuable staple colonies of
the south and the West Indies, and, in case of war with France,
it was essential that England should have some means of
official communication with, and control over, her strongest
colony on the enemy's frontier in America.</p>

<p class='c001'>Over two years had now elapsed since Massachusetts had received
orders to send agents, but she had sent none. She
was, nevertheless, given one last chance. At the end of 1681,
Randolph, who had been in England strongly urging <span lang="la"><i>Quo
Warranto</i></span> proceedings against the charter, arrived in Boston
bearing a letter from the King. It required that more assistance
be given to Randolph as collector, that the Navigation
Acts be enforced, and that agents be sent within three months,
or “wee shall take such further resolutions as are necessary to
preserve our authority from being neglected.”<a id='r976'></a><a href='#f976' class='c014'><sup>[976]</sup></a> The letter
was much milder than the situation really warranted, and
than the wording of a suggested draft by the Lords of Trade.<a id='r977'></a><a href='#f977' class='c014'><sup>[977]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In February, 1682, the letter was read at a General Court,
and, a month later, Stoughton and Joseph Dudley were elected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>agents against considerable opposition. Stoughton again refused
to serve, and Richards was chosen in his place.<a id='r978'></a><a href='#f978' class='c014'><sup>[978]</sup></a> Although
comparatively little is known of him, it appears that
he was strongly opposed to any concessions, whereas Dudley's
more pliant nature and moderate views, influenced perhaps
by ambition to take a leading place under the altered conditions
which he evidently considered inevitable, led him to an
early and willing coöperation with the English government
after the blow had fallen.<a id='r979'></a><a href='#f979' class='c014'><sup>[979]</sup></a> Over three months more elapsed
before the agents sailed, and it was midsummer when they
reached England.<a id='r980'></a><a href='#f980' class='c014'><sup>[980]</sup></a> Although they carried with them confidential
instructions, and a public defense of the colony, they
were given no powers to treat of anything that might tend to
infringe “the liberties and priviledges” granted by the charter
as interpreted by Massachusetts.<a id='r981'></a><a href='#f981' class='c014'><sup>[981]</sup></a> It was obvious, therefore,
that nothing could come of the negotiations, and that there
was no recourse left to the English government except to
acknowledge the virtual independence of the colony, or to
void its charter.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the answer that the agents made on their arrival, there
was little that was new.<a id='r982'></a><a href='#f982' class='c014'><sup>[982]</sup></a> When it was pointed out to them
that the requirement for the franchise had been that no religious
distinction should be made, and no qualification be
necessary, except that the applicant be a freeholder, of the
Protestant religion, taxable at ten shillings, they stated that
there was no other distinction, and that all contrary laws had
been repealed. As was shown by both the law and the practice
of the colony, this statement was false both in fact and in
implication. In reference to the three-years' delay in complying
with the request for agents, they alleged the danger of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>seas, and lack of money, which latter was soon disproved by
their clumsy and unsuccessful attempt to bribe the Lord
Treasurer with £2000, which made them the laughing-stock
of the Court.<a id='r983'></a><a href='#f983' class='c014'><sup>[983]</sup></a> Their answers in other respects were almost
equally unsatisfactory, and their lack of power having been
acknowledged, they were told that they must secure sufficient
authority from the colony or that the <span lang="la"><i>Quo Warranto</i></span> proceedings
would begin.<a id='r984'></a><a href='#f984' class='c014'><sup>[984]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>At the end of March, 1683, the General Court sent them
additional instructions, but did not enlarge their powers,
except that they were authorized to “tender” Maine or anything
else which “our charter will not warrant our keeping.”
They were to reiterate their statements as to the franchise,
and to consent to nothing which would alter their “liberties
and privileges in matters of religion.”<a id='r985'></a><a href='#f985' class='c014'><sup>[985]</sup></a> In the last analysis,
it became evident that the one thing the controlling element in
Massachusetts would not yield was its ecclesiastical power.</p>

<p class='c001'>The King hesitated no longer. Randolph, however, who
carried the notice of the beginning of <span lang="la"><i>Quo Warranto</i></span> proceedings
to Boston, was authorized, at his own suggestion, to offer to
Massachusetts the promise of a full protection of private interests
and property rights, and a liberal regulation of the
charter, if she would voluntarily submit, in which case the
proceedings would be abandoned.<a id='r986'></a><a href='#f986' class='c014'><sup>[986]</sup></a> The wholesale “regulation”
of charters, as then being conducted by the Stuarts in
England, held out little hope of the colony's securing any such
liberties in a new charter as she possessed in the old; but,
on the other hand, not to yield was to lose all, and, in view of
her past record, she could expect little sympathy from any
quarter.</p>

<p class='c001'>The magistrates were in favor of accepting the offer, but the
deputies refused, and the Court continued deadlocked.<a id='r987'></a><a href='#f987' class='c014'><sup>[987]</sup></a> It is
impossible to determine what the public opinion was as to the
situation. In the annual election, in spite of a determined
effort to defeat him, Bradstreet, who was a moderate, secured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>690 votes, against 631 for Danforth, who belonged to the
radicals.<a id='r988'></a><a href='#f988' class='c014'><sup>[988]</sup></a> Dudley, indeed, failed of reëlection, but so, also,
did Richards; and the general result seems to represent only
a slight preponderance for the party of no compromise. It
must be remembered also that, owing to the fact that only
one fifth of the men of the colony possessed the franchise, and
that they were all church members, the vote cannot be taken
to represent the sentiment of the colony as a whole, much
of the discontented element necessarily not showing in the
returns. Under the circumstances, it is significant that over
one half of the church members seem to have voted for Bradstreet
and compromise, for it is fair to presume that they would
include a much larger proportion of irreconcilables than the
unenfranchised body of non-church members, who would have
nothing to gain by fighting England to a finish, in order to
preserve a church of which they were not members, and a
theocratical government which excluded them from power.
Their very legitimate grievance may well have been, indeed,
that that same government, in its effort to preserve privileges
for itself which meant nothing, or worse than nothing, to four
fifths of the inhabitants of the colony, had sacrificed those
other privileges which did mean something to them.</p>

<p class='c001'>We need not enter into the legal details of the course by
which the charter was canceled. The <span lang="la"><i>Quo Warranto</i></span> proceedings
having proved abortive, a writ of <span lang="la"><i>Scire Facias</i></span> was entered,
and, on October 13, 1684, Massachusetts ceased to be a chartered
colony, and found herself without a single one of the
rights to which she had clung so tenaciously.<a id='r989'></a><a href='#f989' class='c014'><sup>[989]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>There seems to be no question of the technical legality of the
proceedings; but, passing beyond those, there is nothing to
regret in the course pursued by the Crown. The interpretation
of the charter by the church party not only was inconsistent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>with the terms of that instrument itself, so that any government
built upon it was illegal and constantly open to attack,
but was inconsistent, also, with the development of liberty
itself in its widest sense. If it were, indeed, true that the
charter formed an unalterable constitution, under which company
members alone were able to become enfranchised citizens,
then the power to govern the state could legally have been
confined forever to the two or three dozen “freemen” who
alone were called for by the charter. The pressure had been
so great that the number of freemen had been greatly enlarged,
it is true; but, according to the leaders' interpretation, this
had been merely a boon granted out of good-will, and no additional
freemen need ever be admitted. Their number might
again be allowed to shrink, by death or disfranchisement, to
the few required to fill the offices, who would, according to
this theory, have the sole power of all government, including
life and death, over the rest of the thirty-five thousand inhabitants.
Although this, of course, was unlikely, nevertheless,
those in control had shown definitely, when in order to maintain
the theocracy they had sacrificed the whole political structure,
rather than abandon their position with reference to extending
the franchise, that nothing but a power so overwhelming
as to be unopposable would have forced them peaceably to
do so.</p>

<p class='c001'>When we speak of liberty in connection with this early
struggle with the home country, we should realize clearly that
the party opposed to England fought to the end to perpetuate
religious intolerance, and the intrenched privilege of a minority
to tax an unenfranchised majority four times as numerous, and
for the right to concentrate all political power in the hands of
one religious sect. The clergy, who had wielded an extraordinary
influence in the counsels of this governing minority, had,
in many instances, been men of marked ability and fanatically
devoted to the truth as they saw it. But as leaders, in the
highest sense, they had very largely failed. From the beginning,
they had striven to banish from the colony all ideas not
in harmony with their own, and had thus lowered and impoverished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>the intellectual life of the community. On nearly
every occasion, they had led in fanning the flames of intolerance
and persecution. Over and over, they had helped to
brutalize the natures of the citizens by calling for the blood of
victims to whom the community would otherwise have shown
mercy. One such example was yet to come, before the colony,
disillusioned, was to reject their leadership finally in civil
affairs.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the present situation must have been of marked effect,
when the people as a whole, non-church members as well as
church members, found that, in the effort to perpetuate the
theocracy, every civil right and safeguard, which they had considered
they possessed under the charter, had been allowed
to be taken from them. It is impossible, as we have said,
accurately to gauge the public sentiment of the time from any
data now available.<a id='r990'></a><a href='#f990' class='c014'><sup>[990]</sup></a> The people, unquestionably, could be
trusted to resist any real efforts from across the water to restrict
such liberties as they were prepared to enjoy. We seem too
often to take it for granted, not only that liberty is something
which all men are entitled to, but that they are at all times
ready for it. The story of their gradually being moulded, so
that they are, in an ever-increasing degree, fit for it, would
seem quite as important as that of their struggle to obtain it.</p>

<p class='c001'>It would have been a great misfortune had the Massachusetts
of 1684 been allowed to go her own way, and to
strengthen and perpetuate the combined ecclesiastical and
political system for which her leaders had fought. As it is,
the influence remains too strong of her fundamental doctrine
that, in matters in any degree tinged with an ethical value, a
minority has the “divine right” to force its will upon the
majority, and to use the arm of the civil power to enforce its
moral views upon the nation. In the town-meeting and the
public school, the founders of Massachusetts, lay and clerical,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>had made two contributions of untold influence to American
political life; but it was well for personal liberty and intellectual
freedom, when the real struggle came and independence
was achieved, that it was for a people who had had some training
in religious toleration and political equality, regardless of
class or creed. And, curiously enough, so tangled is the skein
of history, the laws which voiced and fostered those beliefs
were due to one of the most shameless of English kings, and
not to the fathers of the New England commonwealth.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XVI <br> <br> AN EXPERIMENT IN ADMINISTRATION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In the preceding chapters, we have tried to show the comprehensive
nature of that expansion of Europe which, with
ever-accelerating swiftness, has been in operation since the
age of discovery, and to indicate that, however great an importance
any single colony, English or other, might attribute
to itself, its contemporary significance could be measured relatively
only to the interests of that empire of which it formed a
part. For more or less obvious reasons, this great movement
of expansion has usually been treated from the geographical
standpoint. We think, for example, of England acquiring a
foothold in the Far East or a post in Africa, the island of
Jamaica or that section of America known as Virginia, rather
than of her adding to her empire spices, slaves, sugar, or
tobacco. Columbus, however, did not sail in search of a new
land, but only of a new way to a market; and throughout the
whole of the earlier expansion of Europe, we shall miss much
of its significance, fail to understand its motives and methods,
and misjudge its political ethics and standards, if we allow
ourselves to fall into the way of thinking in geographical units,
with their localized governments, instead of imperially and in
terms of commodities and trade.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the struggle of nations, not for land, but for materials
and markets, on a world-scale, it has been necessary that each
contending empire should be as economically self-contained, as
closely united politically, and as militarily formidable as possible.
Toward the close of the seventeenth century, the conditions of
successful competition were beginning to stand out in somewhat
clearer relief, as a result of the blind gropings and fortuitous
groupings of a century of experiment, in a world whose
economic possibilities had been but little known. In view of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>these requirements, and of the way in which the local New
England policy ran counter to them, there is no need to invoke
any malignant spirit, or even any very deeply selfish aim, on
the part of the later Stuarts, to account for their attempt to
unify and consolidate the Empire. Their policy may have been
shaped only gradually in their own minds, and, in any case,
could assume tangible form only by overcoming the obstacles
of existing conditions and institutions, and by the use of such
instruments as the times, fate, and their own natures allowed
to them. The remainder of this volume will be occupied with
the efforts of themselves and their successors to bring back
the New England colonies into the general life of the Empire,
and to establish those political relations which were to subsist
for another century.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first opportunity for putting into practice the new
policy of consolidated administration and royal control was
offered by New Hampshire when Massachusetts canceled the
commissions of her officials there, in accordance with the
King's orders, in February, 1680. Unfortunately for the colonists,
and for any possible chance of success for the new order,
the question was complicated by the entirely extraneous
one of Mason's title to the land.<a id='r991'></a><a href='#f991' class='c014'><sup>[991]</sup></a> Technically legal as that
may have been, and not wholly without its points even on the
ground of abstract justice, it was not likely that squatters,
who had enjoyed all the rights of possession for two generations,
and who had put their labor into their property, would be
willing to yield, even on nominal terms, unless forced to do so.
Juries would certainly have to be packed if decisions so inimical
to the pocket-books of the colonists were to be obtained in
courts upon the spot; and nothing but ill-feeling and a travesty
of justice could be anticipated, whichever way the verdicts
went; and the King had no intention of spending his hard-won
income to establish Mason's claims by force.</p>

<p class='c001'>Indeed, the royal policy at first was wholly conciliatory. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>government provided consisted of a President and council,
appointed by the King, and a popularly elected assembly,
which latter was to make the laws and levy the taxes, legislation
being subject to veto by the president and council in the
colony, and by the King in Council in England.<a id='r992'></a><a href='#f992' class='c014'><sup>[992]</sup></a> John Cutt,
the first President, and Martyn, Vaughan, Daniel, Gilman,
and Waldron, of the Council, were all prominent men in the
colony; some of them had been officials under Massachusetts.
In fact, under this first royal government in New England,
there was but little change; and the code of laws enacted by
the Assembly was virtually a reënactment of the Massachusetts
code, including some of the characteristic Puritanical criminal
legislation already objected to by the English judges.<a id='r993'></a><a href='#f993' class='c014'><sup>[993]</sup></a> The
laws which were passed confirming the land-titles of towns and
individuals, and providing that, in controversies over lands,
the juries should be “chosen by the freemen of each town,”
were, of course, aimed at the Mason menace, while the method
of selecting juries was inconsistent with English law in the
matter.</p>

<p class='c001'>Having foreseen trouble over the land-question, the King
had required Mason to agree not to demand any compensation
for his property prior to June 12, 1680, and to confirm any
individual in possession of his title forever, subject to a quit-rent
of not over sixpence in the pound, reserving for his own
disposition only the lands not already taken up.<a id='r994'></a><a href='#f994' class='c014'><sup>[994]</sup></a> In December,
Mason and his friend Richard Chamberlain, an English lawyer,
who had been appointed Secretary to the province, arrived in
New Hampshire, and, in compliance with royal orders, Mason
was given a seat in the Council.<a id='r995'></a><a href='#f995' class='c014'><sup>[995]</sup></a> In view, both of the difficulties
which had been experienced, for fifty years, with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>colony's neighbor on the south, and of the fact that the King
had appointed local men to all the government offices, the
necessity of having at least one official who could be relied
upon for information was obvious, and Chamberlain was
instructed to transmit regularly reports of matters transacted
in his office.<a id='r996'></a><a href='#f996' class='c014'><sup>[996]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Council, however, not only made trouble about accepting
him as Secretary, but endeavored to bind him by an oath
of secrecy, which would have prevented the English government
from obtaining information as to events in that part of
the Empire, and have brought about the same absurd and impossible
state of affairs, from an administrative standpoint,
which Massachusetts was trying to perpetuate. Indeed, the
attempt to govern the province by local officials broke down
all along the line. Perhaps the least serious of the difficulties
was that Mason was said to have “no more right to land in
New Hampshire than Robin Hood,” and that he was thwarted
at every turn. So far as that was concerned, he had already
had but scant encouragement in England, where, although
his claims had to be acknowledged as having possible legal
validity, they seem to have been recognized, by a government
anxious to avoid trouble, as being likely to create a great deal
more of it than it cared to find on its hands. Had the local
government shown any inclination to meet the imperial one
half-way in its endeavor to bring about some sort of administrative
connection between the two, and observance of the
Navigation Acts, it is probable that otherwise it would have
been left fairly free, and that the home officials would have
been glad enough to rid themselves of Mason by abandoning
him and his trouble-breeding claims to the local courts.<a id='r997'></a><a href='#f997' class='c014'><sup>[997]</sup></a> This,
however, the colonists refused to do. Complaints, some of
them well-founded, began to pour in to the authorities in
England, not merely in regard to the treatment of Mason,
but as to the loyalty of the province, the recognition of the
King's authority, the character of the laws, the refusal to
observe the Navigation Acts, and other matters, which indicated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>that the local government as organized could not cope
with the situation.<a id='r998'></a><a href='#f998' class='c014'><sup>[998]</sup></a> The Lords of Trade, therefore, reported
that it would be better to reorganize the government and
appoint a governor from home, both as a military and as an
administrative measure. Aside from other questions, there
was evident danger in having a disloyal and disorganized
province on the French frontier in America.</p>

<p class='c001'>Amply justified as the English government might have been
in its appointment of a home official to the post of governor,
its choice of the individual selected was most unfortunate.
It might be said, indeed, to have been inexcusable, did not the
memory of our own happenings during the reconstruction
of the South, for example, after the Civil War, preclude too
free a use of vivid but satisfying adjectives. Edward Cranfield,
however, whose commission was dated May 9, 1682,<a id='r999'></a><a href='#f999' class='c014'><sup>[999]</sup></a>
was, perhaps, the most sordid and reckless character who ever
served the Crown as a provincial governor, and might have
sat as a model to any “carpet-bagger” of our post-bellum
period; and his three years in New Hampshire are but mildly
characterized as “an unbroken record of vulgar oppression
and extortion.”<a id='r1000'></a><a href='#f1000' class='c014'><sup>[1000]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>He had been but a short time in his new office when he began
to have dazzling visions of the wealth to be made by fishing
in the troubled colonial waters. He wrote to Secretary Blathwayt
that, if he and his friend Guinn would further his schemes
in England, they should share equally with himself in the
plunder; and there seems good ground for assuming that
<a id='corr402.28'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Blahwayt'>Blathwayt</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_402.28'><ins class='correction' title='Blahwayt'>Blathwayt</ins></a></span> consented, and that the disgraceful administration
which followed lasted as long as it did by virtue of the
complicity of the bribed secretary in England.<a id='r1001'></a><a href='#f1001' class='c014'><sup>[1001]</sup></a> Cranfield's
astonishingly cool letter asking for a frigate, much as a highway
man might undertake to supply himself with a pistol, on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>the ground that it would not only assist His Majesty's affairs,
but would let himself and his accomplices “in to other advantages,”
is one of the most delightfully frank state papers
on record. He estimated that the troubles in Maine might
be brought to yield £3000; that, as both parties to the Narraganset
dispute had money, £3000 or £4000 would “not be
felt”; that selling pardons in Boston might yield £10,000;
while, besides other possibilities, the £5000 “collected for the
Evangelizing of Indians” might be “inspected into and regulated”—a
suggestion delicately veiled, but sufficiently obvious.
While these enterprises, fortunately, proved beyond
his powers, no amount was too small to attract him, and he
showed an amazing adroitness in turning every incident of his
administration into money for himself, however remote the possibility
of doing so would have seemed to the casual observer.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides the disreputable deal with Blathwayt, which had
probably helped to procure his appointment, Cranfield had
also made one with Mason, by which the latter agreed to pay
him £150 a year, mortgaging the whole province to him as
security.<a id='r1002'></a><a href='#f1002' class='c014'><sup>[1002]</sup></a> It was, therefore, to the advantage of the new
Governor to force the people to accede to Mason's demands.
Although on his arrival, he expressed himself as friendly to the
colony,<a id='r1003'></a><a href='#f1003' class='c014'><sup>[1003]</sup></a> and had little difficulty with his first Assembly, he
fell out with it in its second session, and dissolved it, determined
to rule without one.<a id='r1004'></a><a href='#f1004' class='c014'><sup>[1004]</sup></a> As a result of the feeling over
this action, a disturbance, too insignificant to be called a
revolt, was started by one Edward Gove, who was claimed to
be of unsound mind. However, he was condemned to death
by Cranfield, who confiscated his estate,—of which he promised
one third to Blathwayt,—and shipped the offender to England,
where, after a short stay in the Tower, he was released, in
part owing to appeals by Randolph.<a id='r1005'></a><a href='#f1005' class='c014'><sup>[1005]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>It is needless to follow Cranfield's disreputable course in
detail. It was that of a petty but thoroughly unscrupulous
tyrant, who had no thought for the rights of the people whom
he governed, or for the interests of the Empire, and whose
whole mind was concentrated on picking pockets.<a id='r1006'></a><a href='#f1006' class='c014'><sup>[1006]</sup></a> Although
the Assembly was twice convened again, the deadlock between
it and the executive was complete. Finally, after an effort to
collect taxes illegally, it became evident that the people would
stand no more, and Cranfield, who, somewhat unnecessarily,
seems to have been in fear of his life, wrote home asking for
recall on the score of his health and the difficult climate.<a id='r1007'></a><a href='#f1007' class='c014'><sup>[1007]</sup></a>
Meanwhile, however, the unfortunate inhabitants of the
colony had succeeded in getting their case before the Lords
of Trade in England, who at once took action.<a id='r1008'></a><a href='#f1008' class='c014'><sup>[1008]</sup></a> They wrote
a sharp letter to Cranfield, demanding explanations; and upon
receipt of his defense, which they did not consider satisfactory,
reported to the King that he had exceeded his authority,
committed illegal acts, and failed to carry out his instructions.<a id='r1009'></a><a href='#f1009' class='c014'><sup>[1009]</sup></a>
They also requested that the King allow an immediate appeal
in the case of one Vaughan against Mason, in the matter of
his land-title, and that all proceedings in similar cases be
suspended until His Majesty's decision was known. Unfortunately,
Vaughan lost the appeal, the King deciding in
favor of Mason; but at least Cranfield was removed as governor,
and his commission revoked, at the end of 1684.<a id='r1010'></a><a href='#f1010' class='c014'><sup>[1010]</sup></a> In
order to get rid of the troublesome private claims of Mason, a
plan seems also to have been proposed by the English government,
the following year, by which he was to surrender all his
rights to the Crown in exchange for an annuity and the
governorship of Bermuda, as it was thought the people might
more willingly recognize the claims of the Crown than those
of an individual.<a id='r1011'></a><a href='#f1011' class='c014'><sup>[1011]</sup></a> Nothing, however, came of it, and, like a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>family curse, the Mason claims continued to plague everyone
concerned, including the proprietor himself.</p>

<p class='c001'>That at this crisis in New England affairs, when the attempt
was being made to alter the relations of the colonies to the
Crown, and to make sweeping administrative changes, such a
man as Cranfield could be chosen to be the first representative
of a royal executive, boded ill for the practical success of any
plans, however statesmanlike they might be in conception.
There would seem to be no room for doubt that his appointment
had been due to corruption and jobbery, which were
likely to be the stumbling-blocks in the way of any real improvement
in imperial government under the Stuarts. The
Lords of Trade, indeed, as well as Randolph, both realized and
protested against the dangers of Mason's claim, legal as it
might be, and of the harm to be done by such an appointee as
Cranfield.<a id='r1012'></a><a href='#f1012' class='c014'><sup>[1012]</sup></a> Back-stairs intrigues and sordid schemings, however,
were too strong to be overcome in the court of Charles,
nor had there yet developed that powerful tradition of integrity
and honor, which has been so marked a quality in the
civil service of later England, although the foundations of
such a tradition were being laid at this very time by the excellent
work being done by a number of royal officials in other
colonies.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor must it be forgotten that there was little or nothing
to attract a man of first-rate ability, of high integrity, or of
statesmanlike quality, in the post of royal governor in the
seventeenth century. Owing to the remoteness of the colonies,
their small populations, their lack of culture and social life, the
pettiness of their problems, and the proneness of their inhabitants
to quarrel with any royal official simply as such, the
office of governor could mean only exile, without prestige or
adequate pay, for any man to whom, from ability or position,
a public career was open in England. As for the hungry
schools of smaller fish who swam in their wake, eager to pick
up a living in minor officialdom, it may be said that they were
wont to apply all too thoroughly our later American maxim,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>“to the victor belong the spoils.” They were of the universal
type, transcending time or party, place or race.</p>

<p class='c001'>In respect to the higher officials, the new policy of the
Stuarts, which, by the time Cranfield was removed, had
become clearly marked, might indeed, have brought an advantage.
None of the New England colonies—which ranged
in population from the four thousand of Rhode Island or New
Hampshire, to perhaps ten times that number in Massachusetts—could
offer a problem, or a legitimate recompense,
sufficient to attract an able man as governor; but a dominion
extending from Virginia to New France, impossible as it was
for other reasons, might have done so. Nor were there less
apparent advantages to be gained from the administrative
point of view, in a dominion which should embrace all New
England, such as was now being planned. After the fall of
the Massachusetts charter, and the dismissal of Cranfield,
there were seven jurisdictions in New England, some with
settled governments and some without: Connecticut, the
King's Province, Rhode Island, Plymouth, Massachusetts,
New Hampshire, and Maine. To provide seven complete
sets of administrative machinery for the seventy thousand
persons included in these seven districts naturally seemed to
the government in England to be not only a waste of money
and energy, but likely to interfere with the best interests of
the colonists themselves. The tariff wars, the constant bickering
over boundaries, and the lack of unity in military affairs,
which latter might easily prove fatal when opposed by a
unified, centralized power like France, all seemed to point to
a consolidation of the colonies as being a distinct step forward.
New England, at least, formed a geographical unit, with a
population fairly homogeneous in character; and a general
government might be expected to work with not more friction
than had been developed from the absorption of New Hampshire
and Maine by Massachusetts.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor was the scheme confined solely to the minds of English
Statesmen, or to Randolph, who had urged it as early as 1681.<a id='r1013'></a><a href='#f1013' class='c014'><sup>[1013]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>Not to mention others, so staunch an upholder of the old order
as Samuel Sewall could write to Increase Mather, then engaged
in trying to obtain a new charter, after the downfall of Andros,
that, on account of the lack of voluntary cohesion on the part
of the colonies in the face of the French danger, “it seems
necessary that in the most convenient way as can be procured,
these lesser Governments be firmly compacted into one.”<a id='r1014'></a><a href='#f1014' class='c014'><sup>[1014]</sup></a>
The difficulties in the way of the plan, however, were great.
The local feeling of loyalty, on the part of the colonists, to their
particular colony, and distrust of the others, was amazingly
strong in these little commonwealths, the total population of
any one of which was not greater than that of a town or village
of to-day. Although the inhabitants were all Englishmen, of
much the same faith, and engaged in the same pursuits, the
corporate and community life of the various colonies had, in
the short space of two generations, become differentiated to a
degree which is truly astonishing, and which the contemporary
English government may well be forgiven for not having been
able to realize. Moreover, the extent of territory and inadequacy
of communication made a centralized government peculiarly
difficult for those governing, and inconvenient for the governed.
Lastly, the want of the right sort of men for officials, and their
probable lack of tact, and of sympathy with the New Englanders
at any time, and, particularly, in this one of transition, would
seem to have doomed the dominion to failure from the start.</p>

<p class='c001'>Fortunately, however, New England was saved, largely by
Randolph, from the presence of a governor who would have
been far worse than Cranfield, in the person of the subsequently
notorious Colonel Percy Kirke, who had been appointed by
Charles.<a id='r1015'></a><a href='#f1015' class='c014'><sup>[1015]</sup></a> The death of the King made the commission void;
and Randolph's wise and persistent opposition carried the day,
so that James II found other work for the brutal colonel.<a id='r1016'></a><a href='#f1016' class='c014'><sup>[1016]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>Randolph, indeed, had not hesitated to write that “whoever
goes over Governor with expectation to make his fortunes,
will dis-serve his Majesty, disappoint himself and utterly ruine
that Country”; and that there was “more need of a prudent
man to reconcile then of a hot heady, passionate Souldier to
force.”<a id='r1017'></a><a href='#f1017' class='c014'><sup>[1017]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In August, 1685, he suggested, in view of the inevitable
delay in settling New England matters, resulting from the
death of the King, that a temporary government be installed;
and, a week later, the Lords of Trade recommended the plan
to James.<a id='r1018'></a><a href='#f1018' class='c014'><sup>[1018]</sup></a> It had been Randolph's wish, as well as that of
those citizens in the colony who saw that a change was inevitable,
that the governor and other officials, during the
transition period, should, as far as possible, be local men;
and to this the English government agreed, appointing Joseph
Dudley as Governor.<a id='r1019'></a><a href='#f1019' class='c014'><sup>[1019]</sup></a> It was well for Massachusetts in this
critical time that some, at least, of her leading men were not
fanatically irreconcilable, and that, in spite of the opposition
of the clergy, so able an administrator as Dudley was willing
to take the hated office, and serve at once both his colony and
England.<a id='r1020'></a><a href='#f1020' class='c014'><sup>[1020]</sup></a> If the colonists preferred, as they undoubtedly
did, an administration formed from their own citizens rather
than from strangers, then the question before them was similar
to that put by General Lee to those irreconcilables in Virginia,
in 1867, who refused to vote for the Constitutional Convention.
“The question is,” wrote the general, “shall the members of
the convention be selected from the best available men in the
State or from the worst? Shall the machinery of the State
government be arranged and set in motion by the former or
by the latter?”<a id='r1021'></a><a href='#f1021' class='c014'><sup>[1021]</sup></a> The colonists, indeed, were given no choice
as to the fundamental frame of their government; but the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>powers given to the governor and council made the character
of those who held those offices, particularly the former, of
vital importance.</p>

<p class='c001'>Dudley's commission, which appointed him Governor of
New Hampshire and the King's Province, as well as of Massachusetts,
and was thus the first constructive step taken
toward consolidation, also named the members of his Council.<a id='r1022'></a><a href='#f1022' class='c014'><sup>[1022]</sup></a>
With two exceptions, they were all New Englanders, representative
of the several districts, and included such men as the
Bradstreets, father and son, the two Winthrops (Wait and
Fitz-John), Stoughton, Bulkley, Pynchon, and Tyng, although
the Bradstreets and Saltonstall refused to serve.<a id='r1023'></a><a href='#f1023' class='c014'><sup>[1023]</sup></a> The exceptions
were Mason and Randolph; and when the latter heard
that Mason had been named, he hurriedly wrote to Sir Robert
Southwell, begging that the New Hampshire proprietor
be advised “to moderation” or that he would “putt all in a
ferment.”<a id='r1024'></a><a href='#f1024' class='c014'><sup>[1024]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Although the Dudley government was avowedly temporary,
its organization foreshadowed the more permanent one soon
to be provided, with Andros as head. All executive and judicial
power was placed in the hands of the Governor and Council,
except that appeals to England were provided for in cases involving
not less than £300. There was no provision for the
laying of new taxes or for passing laws, and the refusal to allow
a popular assembly was a serious administrative blunder. In
spite of the restricted franchise and the great influence of the
clergy and a few families in the public life of Massachusetts,
the representative assembly was the foundation of her political
liberties, actual or potential; and after being accustomed to
it for fifty years, the people could be counted upon not to submit
willingly to a form of administration in which they were
deprived of all voice. Randolph, Andros, and the Lords of
Trade all seem to have been in favor of such an assembly for
purposes of legislation and taxation; and the new government
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>under Dudley recommended that it be granted.<a id='r1025'></a><a href='#f1025' class='c014'><sup>[1025]</sup></a> In spite of
this, however, and of the opinion of the Attorney-General
that, even after the forfeiture of the charter, the inhabitants of
Massachusetts still had the right to be directly represented in
the making of their local laws and levying of taxes, the King
refused his consent.<a id='r1026'></a><a href='#f1026' class='c014'><sup>[1026]</sup></a> While the refusal was a stupid error,
which was certain to provoke the people without any material
advantage to the imperial organization, it may be doubted
whether, in truth, it was illegal. The whole matter of the
legal position of the residents in the dominions, as compared
with the dwellers in the realm, was an anomalous one. The
situation resulting from the expansion of England was unprovided
for in the theory of the constitution, much as the
acquisition of dependencies by the United States was unforeseen;
and it is difficult to prove what legal rights an Englishman
may or may not have carried with him in emigrating
beyond seas in the seventeenth century. Although, largely
as a result of the so-called tyranny of Andros, New Englanders
from this time onward began to praise, and claim rights under,
the common law of England, the force of that law had previously
been denied by themselves in statement and practice.<a id='r1027'></a><a href='#f1027' class='c014'><sup>[1027]</sup></a>
In similar case, it may be noted, our own Congress has laid
down the principle that constitutional rights do not of themselves
apply to the citizens of dependent territories, but only
when expressly extended by statute.<a id='r1028'></a><a href='#f1028' class='c014'><sup>[1028]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Randolph arrived with Dudley's commission in May, 1686,
and on the 17th the new government assumed office at a
meeting of the General Court. The members of that body
unanimously protested against the legality of Dudley's commission,
but there was no forcible opposition, though, as
Sewall records, there were “many tears shed in prayer and at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>parting.”<a id='r1029'></a><a href='#f1029' class='c014'><sup>[1029]</sup></a> The actions of the new government showed so
much moderation that Randolph soon began to chafe under
restraint, and complained that “twas still but the Govr &#38;
Company,” and that the Navigation Acts were no more enforced
than formerly.<a id='r1030'></a><a href='#f1030' class='c014'><sup>[1030]</sup></a> Sewall, indeed, in his diary, dwells
only on such minor imperial events as the reintroduction of
the cross in the ensign (which led him to resign his commission),
the drinking of healths, the desecration of Saturday evening
(considered in New England as part of the Sabbath), the increase
of periwigs, and the holding of services by an Anglican
clergyman, in accordance with the religious toleration insisted
upon by the King.<a id='r1031'></a><a href='#f1031' class='c014'><sup>[1031]</sup></a> Randolph, however, who perhaps understood
the colonies better than any other Englishman of the
day, probably represented the feeling more truly when he
wrote that the people were dissatisfied for want of an assembly,
and that otherwise their main desires were for a general pardon,
for the confirmation of their land-titles, and for the legal establishment
of Congregationalism.<a id='r1032'></a><a href='#f1032' class='c014'><sup>[1032]</sup></a> We also get a glimpse of the
fire smouldering beneath the surface, in the refusal of the
Council to permit Captain St. Loe, Commander of H. M.
frigate Dartmouth, to have a celebration and bonfire ashore,
not only, as the Council declared, because the town was built
of wood, but because “the spirits of some people are so royled
and disturbed that inconveniency beyond your expectation
may happen.”<a id='r1033'></a><a href='#f1033' class='c014'><sup>[1033]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>With the appointment of Sir Edmund Andros, who arrived
in December, after Dudley had been in office about seven
months, the Stuart policy was advanced another step, and the
Dominion of New England was soon to receive a larger extension.
The appointment also marked a distinct advance in the
quality of royal official; for Andros was of a type far superior
to the burglarizing Cranfield or the bureaucratic Randolph.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>He had already served with honesty and ability as Governor of
New York; and, as the plans for colonial consolidation called
for the eventual union of that province with New England,
his previous service in the former naturally recommended him
for the higher post. It is probable that he had already been
considered, even before the appointment of Dudley.<a id='r1034'></a><a href='#f1034' class='c014'><sup>[1034]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Although his commission of 1686 added only the small, now
unimportant, colony of Plymouth to the three already combined
under Dudley, the plan for uniting all those north of the
Delaware had been definitely formulated, and, as part of the
process of reorganization, steps had been taken to cancel the
charters of Rhode Island and Connecticut.<a id='r1035'></a><a href='#f1035' class='c014'><sup>[1035]</sup></a> After some consideration
by the Lords of Trade in the previous year, it had
been determined not to await the organization of a permanent
government before proceeding against the two charter colonies,
and Randolph had brought writs of <span lang="la"><i>Quo Warranto</i></span> against each
when he came over with Dudley's commission.<a id='r1036'></a><a href='#f1036' class='c014'><sup>[1036]</sup></a> Before they
could be served, the time for the return of each had expired;
but, nevertheless, Randolph presented both of the “superannuated
summons,” as he termed them, and Rhode Island
made an immediate surrender, precluding the necessity of
forcing the matter to a legal issue.<a id='r1037'></a><a href='#f1037' class='c014'><sup>[1037]</sup></a> That colony was thereupon
placed under the jurisdiction of Andros.<a id='r1038'></a><a href='#f1038' class='c014'><sup>[1038]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Connecticut presented greater difficulties, and, owing to
delays, a second writ of <span lang="la"><i>Quo Warranto</i></span>, served by Randolph,
also became legally void before service. Governor Dongan,
of New York, who had hopes that his province, and not Massachusetts,
might be made the nucleus around which the larger
administrative unit would be built, was also making efforts to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>annex Connecticut, either in whole or in part. Although twice
saved by delay, that colony realized that the tendency of the
time toward consolidation would probably prove too strong
for her to remain permanently isolated.<a id='r1039'></a><a href='#f1039' class='c014'><sup>[1039]</sup></a> Not only were her
social and religious affinities far closer with New England than
with New York, but so, also, were her economic ties. After
some triangular fencing, therefore, with Dongan, Randolph,
and the home authorities, and the service of a third writ, the
General Court wrote to the English Secretary of State, that,
though the colony would prefer to remain independent, yet, if
the King's pleasure were otherwise, she would rather be placed
under the administration of Andros than joined with any
other province.<a id='r1040'></a><a href='#f1040' class='c014'><sup>[1040]</sup></a> This was taken to mean acceptance of the
royal wishes, the <span lang="la"><i>Quo Warranto</i></span> proceedings were dropped,
and Andros was ordered to add Connecticut to the Dominion,
which, six months later, was extended to embrace New York
and the two Jerseys.<a id='r1041'></a><a href='#f1041' class='c014'><sup>[1041]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The difficulties involved in attempting to administer so
vast a territory, possessed of wholly inadequate means of
communication, and embracing such a variety of social, religious,
and economic communities, were virtually insuperable
in the seventeenth century. Difficult as the task would have
been in any case, it was rendered hopeless from the outset by
the opposition of all the colonies involved, and by the lack of
properly qualified men to administer the government, as well
as by those faults of the Stuarts which, it was now evident,
could be counted upon to wreck any administrative policy.</p>

<p class='c001'>The choice of Andros, however, as the man to be entrusted
with bringing about the enormous changes incident to the new
policy, while not altogether happy, was probably as good a
one as the circumstances of the case allowed. The task of
making the new government successful from the standpoint
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>of the King, and acceptable to the inhabitants, was beyond
the power of any man; and under James few were available
for foreign administrative posts who would be likely to be
sympathetically inclined toward the peculiarities of New
Englanders. In an exceedingly difficult position, with his
choice of subordinates mainly limited to greedy place-seekers
from home and honestly disaffected colonials, Andros seems to
have carried out his orders with loyalty and probity, though
not always with tact or discretion.<a id='r1042'></a><a href='#f1042' class='c014'><sup>[1042]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The powers given to him in his commission and instructions
were very broad, and, under the conditions existing in the
colonies, had he, in truth, been the “tyrannical Bajazet”
which he was proclaimed by the Reverend Mr. Mather, the
story of his brief rule would have been very different from
what it was in reality. As had been the case in the temporary
government of Dudley, there was no provision made for a
popular assembly, although Andros himself had no objection
to such a body, and had even tried to secure one for the inhabitants
of New York when Governor of that colony.<a id='r1043'></a><a href='#f1043' class='c014'><sup>[1043]</sup></a> The
King, however, had steadily opposed it in both provinces;
and instead, the Governor, “by and with the advice and
consent of” the Council, or the majority of them, was empowered
to make all laws—which, it may be noted, was the
exact wording of the Act passed by Congress in 1804 for the
government of Louisiana after its purchase from France.<a id='r1044'></a><a href='#f1044' class='c014'><sup>[1044]</sup></a>
The judicial and taxing functions of the government were
bestowed under the same conditions, though the laws passed
were to be approved in England, and appeals were allowed in
cases involving over £300. Although, apparently, the consent
of the Council was required in the above matters, the further
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>power granted the Governor, to suspend summarily any member
of it “from sitting voteing and Assisting therein,” if he
should find “just cause,” gave him virtually sole authority in
the event of disagreement between them and himself, in any
case which he considered just.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such clauses in his instructions as those which required that,
except in cases of extraordinary necessity, he was to act with
not less than seven members of his Council, although his commission
placed the limit at five, and that, further, he was to
permit the members to “enjoy freedom of Debate and Votes
in all things,” would seem to indicate that the English authorities
intended the Council to occupy a position of importance
in the scheme of government. But the scheme was one which
could hardly be workable. If the Council were, in reality, a
body of representatives of various sections and parties, it
would necessarily contain a large number of irreconcilables,
who would constantly be outvoted, as the Crown could not
be expected to appoint a majority from the opposition. Had
the Governor, as was the case in many of the royal colonies,
possessed the executive power, and an elected assembly the
legislative, then the struggle between them would have taken
the course with which the student of colonial history is so
familiar. In the scheme of government which Andros was
supposed to carry out, however, as in that temporarily provided
for Louisiana, the usual rôles of governor and legislature were
reversed, and Andros could quite legitimately consider himself
the sole legislative power, his acts being merely subject to
approval by a body the members of which were, in the first
instance, at least, removable by him. For a half-century,
the one policy of the leaders of Massachusetts, in their effort
to balk England's efforts at control, had been to “avoid or
protract,” and it is not likely that that policy would be suddenly
laid aside. The complaints made in general terms by five of
the later accusers of Andros, that in legislation he did not give
sufficient opportunity for debate, that laws were passed with
only a bare quorum, and that, sometimes, the votes were not
counted, cannot, even if true, be taken as very serious charges,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>considering his actual powers, and the practical difficulties
which beset him.<a id='r1045'></a><a href='#f1045' class='c014'><sup>[1045]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>An attempt was, indeed, made to have the Council, which
at first comprised twenty-seven members, roughly representative
of the various parts of the Dominion; and, as other
provinces were added, the membership was enlarged to permit
the seating of members from them. Nor were prominent
names wanting in the list, which included Dudley, the two
Winthrops, Stoughton, Hinckley, William Bradford, Arnold,
Tyng, Pynchon, Treat, and Allyn.<a id='r1046'></a><a href='#f1046' class='c014'><sup>[1046]</sup></a> Under the circumstances,
however, such an attempt was bound to break down, for important
men from other parts of the Dominion could not be
expected to remain permanently in Boston, or to make frequent
and long journeys thither, in order to attend meetings
of a body whose only powers were those of advice and veto,
and even those of none too strong a character. It was entirely
natural, therefore, that, during the brief rule of Andros, the
actual conduct of affairs should tend, more and more, to be
guided by his own will and that of a clique among the councillors,
and that attendance at the meetings should have
steadily dwindled.</p>

<p class='c001'>As in the case of New Hampshire, the question of the establishment
of a new administrative machinery was complicated
by the distinct one of titles to the land. In the former
case the unhappy complication had been forced upon the English
government, as the question in that province had not been
as to the rights of the Crown against those of its subjects, but
as to the legal claims of one subject against those of others. In
Massachusetts, the case was entirely different; and although the
colonists were technically at fault in not having taken out valid
titles when they might readily have done so, nevertheless, the
course of the English government was both stupid and unjust.</p>

<p class='c001'>Throughout all the colonies in the early period, there was a
general and rather likeable prejudice against professional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>lawyers. But, unfortunately, that prejudice, if indulged in
too rashly in civilized society, is apt to entail some <span lang="fr"><i>mauvais
quarts d'heures</i></span> on occasion. In New England, not only was
there an almost total absence of professional lawyers, but
there seems to have been very little legal knowledge among
any class in the community. The most marked difference between
the libraries of that section and those of Virginia, in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, is the rapidly increasing
number of law-books to be found on the shelves as we journey
southward. In New England, not only was the whole administration
of justice in the hands of laymen who had little or no
knowledge of law, but the most important legal questions with
reference to the charter were, in virtually every case, referred
to the clergy, who seem to have been delightfully ignorant of
legal theory and practice, as evidenced both by their decisions
and by the fairly complete absence of any books on the subject
in their studies. They had proved but blind leaders of the
blind, and the insistence upon popular, but erroneous, interpretations
of charter rights, which had necessitated the voiding
of that instrument, now threatened an overwhelming disaster,
which might easily have been averted had the leaders been
possessed of better legal training.</p>

<p class='c001'>As we saw in an earlier chapter, virtually all the land granted
in Massachusetts, as well as in those other New England
colonies which possessed charters, had been bestowed upon
towns in their corporate capacity, and by them granted to individuals.
But as the original company had had no power to
create other corporations, the towns, as such, had no legal
existence, and could not, therefore, give valid title to land.
Moreover, a company could not act except under its seal; which
the Massachusetts Company had rarely used in giving title.
It may well be that Randolph was far nearer the truth than
usual in his figures, when he wrote to Blathwayt that he did
not believe that “10 men hold of better Title then Town Grants
or Indian Purchase and not Three have a Grant legally executed.”<a id='r1047'></a><a href='#f1047' class='c014'><sup>[1047]</sup></a>
Just as the substitution of Exodus, Deuteronomy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>and the discretion of the magistrate for the common law of
England could continue workable only so long as too many
alien elements, which would naturally find such a system
“uncongenial and oppressive,” were not added to the population,
so a land-title, as derived by the Reverend Mr. Higginson
from “the Grand Charter in Genesis 1st. and 9th. Chapters,”
from Adam through Noah, could remain satisfactory only
until questioned by purchasers more used to modern forms.<a id='r1048'></a><a href='#f1048' class='c014'><sup>[1048]</sup></a>
One of the last acts of Connecticut under her charter, before
submitting, had been to validate land-titles by confirming
under seal, to individuals, all lands previously granted through
towns; thus there was no land question in Connecticut.<a id='r1049'></a><a href='#f1049' class='c014'><sup>[1049]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But, aside from land in individual possession, there were, in
most of the colonies, very large amounts as yet ungranted at
all, or still possessed and used by towns in the then essential
form of “commons” for wood and pasture. Andros, in his
instructions, had been directed to dispose of all lands “yet undisposed
of,” and others “for which Our Royall Confirmation
may be wanting,” for a moderate quit-rent, not under two
shillings and sixpence for every hundred acres. He was also
instructed that no man's “Freehold or Goods” were to “be
taken away or harmed,” but by laws agreeable to those of
England.<a id='r1050'></a><a href='#f1050' class='c014'><sup>[1050]</sup></a> How far it may have been the considered policy
of the home government to take advantage of the technical
invalidity of title to allotted land, and how far such attempts
as were made may have been due to Andros's own reading,
correct though it was, of his orders, it is impossible to say.
That the Crown came into possession of the unallotted lands
could be disputed by no one. In regard to those that had been
improved, the only statesmanlike action would have been to
confirm existing titles without rent. They were, to a great
extent, in the hands of innocent holders, who had naturally
believed that the colony's leaders, lay and clerical, who for
two generations had constituted the government, would have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>known enough to give a valid title when they granted land.</p>

<p class='c001'>Not only had the people for a long period enjoyed undisturbed
possession, but, to a considerable extent, as we have
already pointed out, New England had been settled by emigrants
to whom such possession of land in fee simple had been
the main attraction. In fact, in respect to land, the New
England migration had accomplished what the English Revolution
had failed to do, and had virtually redistributed property.
It has often been said—not quite truly, perhaps—that the
English movement did not succeed because it left the injustices
and inequalities of the English property system untouched.
To have done otherwise would have meant the expropriation
of a large and powerful class. In the wilderness of America,
the unlimited fund of free land could be drawn upon for the
purpose, and an economic leveling be accomplished with no
disturbance of existing rights. It was another of the results
of the influence of the frontier, to which, in the story of America,
we have to come back over and over again; for it was in this
free and abundant land that were sown the seeds of democracy
and revolution. In New England, owing in part to social
and in part to geographic factors, the equalizing of economic
status had proceeded further, perhaps, than anywhere else at
that time; and the resultant wide distribution of small holdings
would there cause the maximum, both of dissatisfaction with
any policy attacking titles, and of difficulty in enforcing it.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is, perhaps, only fair to say that the English government
may not have realized the full extent of the popular feeling,
and that they probably thought that the sum asked, which
was less than a third of a penny per acre, would be willingly
paid as a means of permanently validating the imperfect titles.
All those residents of Boston interested in the Narragansett
country had voluntarily offered, a year previously, to pay such
a quit-rent as the amount asked later, and the government of
Massachusetts itself had collected quit-rents from its own citizens
in Maine.<a id='r1051'></a><a href='#f1051' class='c014'><sup>[1051]</sup></a> The policy of questioning all titles constituted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>a typical example of Stuart injustice and ineptitude;
and the few test cases which Andros brought were handled in
a way to afford the greatest degree of apprehension and irritation.
The needy and ill-paid minor officials, upon whom he
had to depend in large part for the details of his administration,
immediately scented plunder, and sought recklessly to profit
by it. Although the actual number of cases in which titles
were attacked individually was very small, the theory on
which the cases were based threatened virtually every individual
outside of Connecticut; and it is hard to conceive of
any other blunder that the government could have made which
would, so instantly, have arrayed an entire population in opposition.
It is unnecessary to go into the details of the cases,
for there is but one answer to the question, “What people
that had the spirits of Englishmen could endure this?”<a id='r1052'></a><a href='#f1052' class='c014'><sup>[1052]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Cranfield, who had had hopes of getting the governorship of
Massachusetts for himself, had predicted that all might go
well there, “provided that Religion and Tertenancy doe not
hinder”; and, at least, had thus shown himself capable of
picking out two of the probable rocks on which the Dominion
policy might founder.<a id='r1053'></a><a href='#f1053' class='c014'><sup>[1053]</sup></a> The fact that the new government
was pledged to allow liberty of conscience to all persons would,
in itself, have been sufficiently obnoxious to the clergy and
old church party, even had not the clause been added that the
Church of England was to be especially encouraged.<a id='r1054'></a><a href='#f1054' class='c014'><sup>[1054]</sup></a> Andros
had been preceded in his arrival by the Reverend Mr. Ratcliffe,
a minister of that church, and “extraordinary good preacher,”<a id='r1055'></a><a href='#f1055' class='c014'><sup>[1055]</sup></a>
and Randolph and Mason had petitioned for the use of one
of the three Boston meeting-houses in which to hold services.
This, quite naturally, had been refused, and the services were
being held in the Town-house when the new Governor reached
Boston. Andros repeated the request, and was again refused,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>the Town-house continuing to be used until the following
March, when the Governor once more reopened the question.
Having no better success than before, he obtained the key
of the South Meeting-house from the sexton, and forced the
issue.<a id='r1056'></a><a href='#f1056' class='c014'><sup>[1056]</sup></a> From that time forward, the two congregations held
services there on Sunday mornings, the one following the other.
The sermons of the Puritan divines were of such inordinate
length that even the late Dudley government, though firm in
the faith and New England bred, had to pass a resolution that
“the minister that preaches on Thursday next be prayed from
this Court to hasten his Sermon because of the short days”;<a id='r1057'></a><a href='#f1057' class='c014'><sup>[1057]</sup></a>
and one Sabbath morning was scarcely long enough for two
clergymen. Moreover, the wholly warranted sense of injustice
felt by the Congregationalists would not tend toward
easing a situation which, in the best of cases, would have been
likely to breed constant ill-feeling. Ecclesiastical quarrels are
never lacking in venom, and the intensity of the friction developed
in the present case was naturally intense. Within
the year, however, the Episcopalians made an effort to build a
church of their own, though not without difficulty, for Sewall,
who was one of those who complained of their using the Meeting-house,
refused to sell them land upon which “to set up that
which the People of N. E. came over to avoid.”<a id='r1058'></a><a href='#f1058' class='c014'><sup>[1058]</sup></a> But a new
church was at last built, although Andros never worshiped
in the King's Chapel, as it was called, the Revolution occurring
before its completion. His religious sincerity is witnessed
by the fact that, when he sailed for England, virtually a
prisoner, he left £30 as a gift toward the building.<a id='r1059'></a><a href='#f1059' class='c014'><sup>[1059]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Arbitrary and unnecessarily irritating as was the Governor's
course in the matter, it must be confessed to have been a very
mild form of religious tyranny, as compared with that customarily
indulged in by the Puritans themselves. But in
various minor ways he gave additional offense to the clergy
and more bigoted laymen, whose Puritanism had at this time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>reached its narrowest point. On Christmas Day, the observance
of which was punishable by fine under the colony's
laws, Sewall sadly observes that the “governor goes to the
Town-House to Service Forenoon and Afternoon”; though
he takes some heart by noting that “shops open today generally
and persons about their occasions.”<a id='r1060'></a><a href='#f1060' class='c014'><sup>[1060]</sup></a> A little later, Increase
Mather writes in his diary, that “this Sabbath [Saturday]
night was greatly profaned by bonfires &#38;c. under pretence of
honor to the King's Coronation.” A sort of secondary Sabbath
had been developed by the clergy about the mid-week “lecture,”
and on one of these days, Mather notes that “Sword
playing was this day openly practised on a Stage in Boston
&#38; that immediately after the Lecture, so the Devil has begun
a Lecture in Boston on a Lecture day which was set up for
Christ.”<a id='r1061'></a><a href='#f1061' class='c014'><sup>[1061]</sup></a> Happily, the old order was changing, and the community
was gradually loosening the shackles of what, for most,
had become merely a dreary formalism.</p>

<p class='c001'>In an earlier chapter, we attempted to show what a change
was wrought in the attitude of the Puritans when they passed
from opposition to the government in England to the control
of that in the colony. Under Andros, they now once more
found themselves in opposition; and it is instructive to note
in how many particulars they again proclaimed as tyranny
what they had themselves been practising. We have seen
how laws had been passed prohibiting anyone from settling
in the colony, or leaving it without the consent of the rulers.
These laws had never been repealed by the colonial authorities,
but it was now complained that “whereas by constant usage
any person might remove out of the countrey at his pleasure,
a Law was made that no man should do so without the Governours
leave.” In view of the continuous refusal of the Puritan
government, when in power, to permit any dissatisfied citizen
to go to England to lodge complaint against their arbitrary
acts, of which refusal many examples have been cited, the
complaints against Andros in the matter are an amusing instance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>of immediate change of feeling upon discovering whose
ox was being gored. There is nothing to indicate that Andros
had any intention of preventing anyone from carrying an
appeal; but the same writer who complained of the above act
goes on to say, with an entire lack of humor, considering the
past history of the colony, “how should any dissatisfied persons
ever obtain liberty to go to England to complain of their being
oppressed by Arbitrary Governours?”<a id='r1062'></a><a href='#f1062' class='c014'><sup>[1062]</sup></a> As a matter of fact,
dissatisfied persons now possessed that liberty for the first
time in the history of Massachusetts.</p>

<p class='c001'>Under the former régime, the right to organize churches,
the regulation of the schools, and the licensing of printing, had
all been kept rigidly under the control of the government,
which meant the representatives of the minority of the population
constituting the Congregational church. But a loud cry
of tyranny was raised when the new government passed an
act that no schools should be kept except “such as shall be
allowed,” and established Dudley as censor of the press, which
Hutchinson admits merely changed its keeper.<a id='r1063'></a><a href='#f1063' class='c014'><sup>[1063]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The order that all records of the former governments should
be lodged at Boston undoubtedly entailed hardship for anyone
who wished to examine them; and the requirement that
final action in the probating of wills or granting letters of administration,
in estates of the value of over £50, must take
place in Boston was also an unpractical attempt at bureaucratic
centralization.<a id='r1064'></a><a href='#f1064' class='c014'><sup>[1064]</sup></a> Moreover, West, to whom Randolph
had farmed out the office of Secretary, was a peculating subordinate,
of whom Randolph later wrote that he “extorts
what fees he pleases, to the great oppression of the people, and
renders the present government grievous.”<a id='r1065'></a><a href='#f1065' class='c014'><sup>[1065]</sup></a> The legal fees,
as enacted in 1687, were fair and moderate,—that for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>probate of a will, for example, being ten shillings,—and there
is only questionable evidence for Hutchinson's statement, inaccurate
in another respect, that the usual charge was fifty
shillings.<a id='r1066'></a><a href='#f1066' class='c014'><sup>[1066]</sup></a> But there is some evidence that West and some of
the minor officials attempted extortion even after the establishment
of an official scale; and Randolph complained that
two of them, West being one, were insubordinate in Maine,
where they “were as arbitrary as the great Turke,” and were
upsetting matters already settled by Andros.<a id='r1067'></a><a href='#f1067' class='c014'><sup>[1067]</sup></a> How far Andros
might have been able to organize the enormous and administratively
unwieldy dominion, and rid himself of unreliable
subordinates, had he been given time, cannot be known, as he
was to have only a few months in which to do so after the
addition of the southern provinces.</p>

<p class='c001'>Aside from these and other difficulties, his administration
would undoubtedly have been wrecked on the question of
taxation, whether the Revolution had occurred in England or
not. He himself, and every one else apparently, except the
King, realized the necessity for an elected assembly; but it
had been denied, and there was, therefore, nothing to do but
to levy the taxes without the direct consent of the people.
Under his commission, Andros, “by and with the advice and
consent” of a majority of his Council, had been given power
to levy such taxes as might be necessary for the support of the
government;<a id='r1068'></a><a href='#f1068' class='c014'><sup>[1068]</sup></a> and at the session of March 1, 1687, a general
bill, embodying some former ones, was presented for consideration.
It aroused warm discussion over details, and both
the records, and the long subsequent complaint of Stoughton
and others that Andros had “held the Council together unreasonably
a very long time about it,” would indicate that on
that day, at least, there had been no suppression of freedom of
debate.<a id='r1069'></a><a href='#f1069' class='c014'><sup>[1069]</sup></a> After a second reading, and a lapse of two days, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>was passed on the third day, <span lang="la"><i>nemine contradicente</i></span>, according
to the records, though the complainants, several years later,
claimed that the vote had not been counted, and that many
of the councilors had remained silent, under “great discouragement
and discountenance.”<a id='r1070'></a><a href='#f1070' class='c014'><sup>[1070]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The attempt to levy the tax met with immediate resistance
in Essex County, and particularly in the town of Ipswich,
where the men assembled in town-meeting refused to elect an
assessor. Under the leadership of John Wise, certain of the
inhabitants drew up a protest, stating that their liberties as
Englishmen had been infringed, and refusing to pay any taxes
not levied by an elected assembly.<a id='r1071'></a><a href='#f1071' class='c014'><sup>[1071]</sup></a> Twenty-eight were at
once arrested, of whom a number, “appearing more ingenuous
and less culpable,” were promptly released.<a id='r1072'></a><a href='#f1072' class='c014'><sup>[1072]</sup></a> Six, however,
supposed to be the ringleaders, were thrown into prison at
Boston, a writ of <span lang="la"><i>habeas corpus</i></span> having been denied.<a id='r1073'></a><a href='#f1073' class='c014'><sup>[1073]</sup></a> When
they were later brought to trial, Dudley was the presiding judge,
and Wise claimed that the jury was packed for the occasion.
The six were fined, in all, £185, and forced to pay heavy charges
in court fees, while Wise was suspended from his ministerial
functions. The fines were large, but the offense naturally
was serious in the eyes of Andros, who had, perforce, to carry
out a policy not of his own making; and it may not be unfair
to recall that, in the days when the “saddle was upon the Bay
mare,” the Puritans had levied fines of £750 upon Dr. Child
and his fewer associates.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although the towns, as has been stated, had never had
legal standing as corporations, and, with the overthrow of the
charter, had ceased to have a political one, the new government
had, nevertheless, allowed them to continue functioning much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>as usual. As a result of the attitude of those in Essex on the
tax-matter, however, the Council passed a law limiting town-meetings
to one a year for the purpose of electing local officers,
and thus struck at the very root of popular government in the
colony.<a id='r1074'></a><a href='#f1074' class='c014'><sup>[1074]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The addition of one colony after another, in rapid succession,
to the province for which Andros was responsible, raised administrative
problems of the gravest sort, and had necessitated
journeys from Boston to Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New
York. When the last-named had been placed under his rule,
in 1688, he had also been given the main control over Indian
affairs for nearly all English North America, and had also
had to journey to Albany for a conference with the Mohawks.
With wholly inadequate assistance from the greedy office-seekers,
who in large part formed his staff, his position was
certainly an unenviable one. It was not long before the
Indian question on the eastern frontier, with the larger danger
of the French lurking in the background, also arose, to add to
the difficulties of the harassed Governor. It was, unquestionably,
a wise policy to unite the Indian affairs of all the colonies
under one head; for the French in the valleys of the St. Lawrence
and the Mississippi now threatened the entire rear of
the English empire on the continent, and in the impending
struggle between the two, the allegiance of the Indian tribes
dwelling between them would become a factor of supreme importance.
The disunited English colonies, quarreling among
themselves, and wholly selfish in the various policies pursued
by them in relation to the natives, offered a contrast, palpable
enough to the savages, to the unified control of the French.</p>

<p class='c001'>Andros had already made one trip to the eastward, in the
spring of 1688, for the purpose of restoring the fort at Pemaquid;
and while there, had despoiled the home of St. Castine,
an intruding French trader, who was living a half-savage life
with an assorted selection of Indian wives, more notable for
number than for virtue.<a id='r1075'></a><a href='#f1075' class='c014'><sup>[1075]</sup></a> The Governor called together the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>sachems of the local tribes, endeavored to bind them to the
English cause, and then had to proceed to New York. While
he was detained there, several minor Indian attacks occurred
at New Haven, up the Connecticut River, and in Maine,
resulting in the killing, in all, of some twenty-six whites.<a id='r1076'></a><a href='#f1076' class='c014'><sup>[1076]</sup></a>
After a proclamation ordering the Indians to restore their
prisoners and surrender the murderers had proved unavailing,
Andros organized an expedition of several hundred men, and
himself marched with them into Maine, destroying many of
the Indian settlements, and capturing much of their ammunition
and supplies.<a id='r1077'></a><a href='#f1077' class='c014'><sup>[1077]</sup></a> Randolph claims, however, what is confirmed
by other documents, that Boston merchants sent the
enemy a vessel of forty-two tons loaded with powder, shot, and
food, and so undid much of Andros's work.<a id='r1078'></a><a href='#f1078' class='c014'><sup>[1078]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Indian troubles were made the basis for the spreading
of alarming rumors that Andros was intending to turn the
colonies over to France, and introduce popery, and even that
the Mohawks were to be called in to destroy Boston. All
sorts of trumpery evidence was adduced to lend color to these
unfounded libels, to which even Increase Mather did not
hesitate to lend his influence.<a id='r1079'></a><a href='#f1079' class='c014'><sup>[1079]</sup></a> While they were utterly without
foundation so far as Andros was concerned, who treated
them with deserved contempt, they fitted in with both the
religious and political fears of Protestant Englishmen in the
closing years of the Stuarts. Moreover, recently published
letters of Randolph now show that he, at least, had begun to
trim his sails to meet a possible breeze from Rome, should
James make England a Catholic country; and his suggestion
as to the superior usefulness of Jesuits, as instruments among
the Indians, and even of the possibility of establishing a monastery,
may have been noised abroad.<a id='r1080'></a><a href='#f1080' class='c014'><sup>[1080]</sup></a> As we have already
noted, the mentality of the Massachusetts of this period was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>peculiarly liable to panic and fantastic fears; and whether or
not the leaders believed the fables they spread, they undoubtedly
realized that the readiest way to organize a revolution
against Andros would be by religious prejudice.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is probable that the fundamental weakness of the King's
policy would have borne its natural fruit, even had there been
no Revolution in England; but that event was to offer the
most favorable opportunity for the minor movement in the
colony. Andros was still at Pemaquid when he received what
was probably his first intimation of the coming attempt to
overthrow the government in England, in the form of a proclamation,
which the King ordered to be published, calling upon
all subjects to show their loyalty in view of a threatened invasion
from Holland.<a id='r1081'></a><a href='#f1081' class='c014'><sup>[1081]</sup></a> By the end of March, 1689, the Governor
was back in Boston, and, ten days later, young John Winslow
arrived from the island of Nevis, with news of Prince William's
landing in England and a copy of his declaration.<a id='r1082'></a><a href='#f1082' class='c014'><sup>[1082]</sup></a> Rumors
had also reached Andros, who requested Winslow to show him
the declaration as confirmation. On Winslow's refusal, Andros
told him he was “a saucy fellow,” and had him committed to
jail for overnight, releasing him in the morning, when he
showed the paper to the magistrate.<a id='r1083'></a><a href='#f1083' class='c014'><sup>[1083]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Andros's position was a difficult one. Although not in sympathy
with much both in the religious position and in the
absolutist tendencies of his Stuart masters, he had to the full
the soldierly qualities of obedience and loyalty, and on the
16th of April, he wrote to Brockholls in New York that there
was “a general buzzing among the people,” and warned the
magistrates and officers to be on their guard against probable
trouble.<a id='r1084'></a><a href='#f1084' class='c014'><sup>[1084]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Two days after, on the 18th, the storm broke in Boston.
There is evidence to indicate that the leaders had laid their
plans some time in advance, and that the staging of the events
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>followed a preconcerted arrangement, in spite of their feigned
ignorance.<a id='r1085'></a><a href='#f1085' class='c014'><sup>[1085]</sup></a> Early in the morning, armed crowds of men and
boys proceeded to the centre of the town from either end,
captured Randolph, several of the justices, the sheriff, a
number of the captains, and others of the government, and
locked them in the jail. Andros had already taken refuge in
the fort, while Dudley was absent on Long Island. Bradstreet,
Danforth, and others of the popular leaders were escorted to
the Town-house, and at noon a lengthy, and certainly not
hastily prepared, declaration was read to the assembled people
from a balcony.<a id='r1086'></a><a href='#f1086' class='c014'><sup>[1086]</sup></a> It was an able, but exceedingly biased,
indictment of the Andros government, while the art of the
demagogue was evident in the weaving in of old slanders as
to the Governor's pretended treachery with the French and
Indians, the raking up of the Popish Plot in England, and
a passing tribute to the “Scarlet Whore.” It ended with
flattering references to the Prince of Orange, and the statement
that the persons of “those few Ill men,” who had been the
authors of the colony's misery, had been seized lest they should
have given the province “away to a Forreign Power,” before
orders might be received from the new Parliament. The
wording would indicate that it had been expected that Andros,
and perhaps Dudley, who, with Randolph, were certainly the
chief of the “ill men” in popular estimation, would already
have been in custody by the time it was read. Andros's
having taken refuge in the fort probably upset the plans in
that respect. The paper contains every internal evidence,
indeed, of having been prepared some time before, and certainly
not after, the mob had begun its work on that eventful
morning. Nevertheless, Winthrop, Bradstreet, Stoughton,
Danforth, and others of the leaders immediately drew up
another, stating that the action of the people was a surprise,
of “the first motion whereof” they had been entirely ignorant,
and calling upon Andros to surrender the government, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>deliver up the fort, which otherwise would be carried by
storm.<a id='r1087'></a><a href='#f1087' class='c014'><sup>[1087]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>To have held the little fort, or the defenses on Castle Island,
for any length of time, in the face of overwhelming odds, would
have been impossible. To have defended the fort temporarily
against attack would merely have caused useless bloodshed;
and, fortunately for the colonists, Andros, throughout his
whole career, had never shown the bloodthirsty vindictiveness
of an Endicott or a Norton. That he was no coward is
shown by the fact that he abandoned the shelter of the fort,
and made his way through the tumultuous streets to a personal
conference with the revolutionary leaders gathered in the
council chamber. The meeting, however, effected no compromise;
Andros was made prisoner, and, through one of his
subordinates, but apparently on his orders, the fort was surrendered.
The following day, the Castle also was yielded,
and possession taken of the frigate, though the latter, in order
to save the men's pay, was not required to be formally surrendered.
Some days later, Dudley was located in the Narragansett
country, brought to Boston, and placed in the common
jail. In Europe, James II had dropped the Great Seal of
England in the Thames, and fled to France. In America, his
Dominion of New England lay shattered.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XVII <br> <br> THE NEW ORDER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Just a year before the events of that 18th of April, described
at the close of the last chapter, the Reverend Increase Mather
had sailed for England as representative of “many congregations”
in the colony, in an effort to secure from King James the
restoration of an assembly, confirmation of land-titles, and as
many of the old charter privileges as possible. Although he
was more than once received in audience by the King, before
the Revolution brought the negotiations to an abrupt end,
it had been evident for some time that the churches' agent was
likely to gain little more than fair words and memories of
royal interviews.<a id='r1088'></a><a href='#f1088' class='c014'><sup>[1088]</sup></a> He had, however, succeeded in making
useful friends, one among whom, Sir Henry Ashurst, became
associated with him as agent, and another, Lord Wharton,
introduced him to the Prince of Orange a month before the
coronation, enabling him thus early to present a petition for
the restoration of the charter.<a id='r1089'></a><a href='#f1089' class='c014'><sup>[1089]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Three days after that interview, a circular letter was prepared,
to be sent to all the English colonies, ordering officials
then in office to continue to administer affairs temporarily
until the new government could send different instructions.<a id='r1090'></a><a href='#f1090' class='c014'><sup>[1090]</sup></a>
Word of this was given to Mather by Jephson, a cousin of
Wharton and an under-secretary to the King. Mather's
alarm, when he heard of it, would seem to indicate that he
either had definite information of the uprising planned in
Boston, or very strong suspicions of what might occur. Prince
William had already been two months in England, and it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>incredible that Mather should not have sent home some word
of an event of such overwhelming importance to the colony
as the overthrow of the Stuart monarchy. His later censure
of the colonists for not having promptly resumed the charter
government, instead of temporizing, and his laying the blame
for his partial failure in England upon their not having done
so, may also suggest the nature of the advice sent by him.<a id='r1091'></a><a href='#f1091' class='c014'><sup>[1091]</sup></a>
He could hardly have expected the new King to determine
offhand the form of government for the Dominion of New
England, then constituting over one half of the empire in
America. An order for a few months' longer continuance of
the Andros government, under the circumstances, would not
have been a serious matter, unless that government had already
been overthrown, or was about to be, by the colonists' acts.
However that may be, Mather and Sir William Phips, now
also temporarily in London, petitioned against the dispatch of
the letter to New England, and succeeded in having orders
issued instead for a new governor in place of Andros, and a
temporary form of government, to include a popular assembly.<a id='r1092'></a><a href='#f1092' class='c014'><sup>[1092]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>News of the revolution at Boston reached London the last
week in June, and soon letters from Randolph and others
supplied the English government with the details of what had
occurred.<a id='r1093'></a><a href='#f1093' class='c014'><sup>[1093]</sup></a> Toward the end of July, orders were issued to the
provisional government in Boston to send Andros and the
other prisoners to England “forthwith,” on the first ship bound
thither, and that they be treated civilly.<a id='r1094'></a><a href='#f1094' class='c014'><sup>[1094]</sup></a> The order was not
received in Massachusetts until November 24, and then was
not complied with.<a id='r1095'></a><a href='#f1095' class='c014'><sup>[1095]</sup></a> Although two ships were ready to sail
in December, an embargo was laid upon the vessels, and it
was not until the middle of the next February that the prisoners,
after treatment which they considered unnecessarily harsh,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>were allowed to start.<a id='r1096'></a><a href='#f1096' class='c014'><sup>[1096]</sup></a> It had probably been felt that their
presence in London might interfere with the success of the
colony's agents.</p>

<p class='c001'>The leaders who had planned the Boston revolution had undoubtedly
desired the eventual restoration of the old charter,
and the return of the Church and themselves into control of
the government. It is probable also that the majority of the
inhabitants wished for the reëstablishment of charter government,
which they looked upon as ensuring themselves against
arbitrary acts by England or English officials. The desires
of the people as a whole, however, were by no means identical
with those of the leaders who formed the temporary government
in Boston, or were acting as agents in England, virtually
all of whom were of the narrowest clerical party. When the
fall of the Andros government necessitated the formation of
another, those who had taken the lead on the day of its overthrow
associated twenty-two others with themselves, and
formed a “Council for the safety of the people and conservation
of the peace,” with Bradstreet and Wait Winthrop in the
chief offices.<a id='r1097'></a><a href='#f1097' class='c014'><sup>[1097]</sup></a> The decision of a convention, held May 8, as
to a new government was not considered sufficiently decisive,
and another was convened, which included representatives
from fifty-four towns. Hutchinson says that “two days were
spent in disputes,” and that “the people without doors were
also much divided in sentiments.” Apparently the representatives
of forty towns voted in favor of resuming the charter,
and those of fourteen against it.<a id='r1098'></a><a href='#f1098' class='c014'><sup>[1098]</sup></a> A compromise, not only
between those for and against the charter, but also between
those for and against the expediency of immediate resumption,
resulted in the formation of a government composed of those
officials who had been chosen in the last election under the
old charter. Within a few weeks, Plymouth, which had never
had a charter, and Connecticut and Rhode Island, the legal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>proceedings against which had never been consummated, also
quietly resumed their former governments.<a id='r1099'></a><a href='#f1099' class='c014'><sup>[1099]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Of the points to be considered in granting a new charter for
Massachusetts, or the resumption of the old one, those most
likely to be discussed by the people—outside of the question
of land-titles, as to which the colonists were naturally
unanimous—would be the assembly, the governorship, and
the franchise. As to the justice and necessity of a representative
body for legislation and taxation, there was probably
no difference of opinion in the colony. For that matter, as
we saw in the last chapter, there was virtually none in the
English government at home, or among its officials in Massachusetts,
with the all-important exception of the late, but
unlamented, monarch. As to the governor, it was natural
that the majority of the people should prefer a chief magistrate
elected by themselves rather than one appointed by England,
though it is not at all certain that they were right. The old
oligarchical government had grossly misused its power, and
those who had a keen recollection of what toleration had
meant in the days before Andros, and who realized the military
danger in the old system of small, disunited, and contentious
colonies, can certainly be accused of no lack of “patriotism”
in their preference for a royal governor, to serve as a
check upon the intolerance and military incapacity of the old
régime.</p>

<p class='c001'>Probably the most disputed point, and the one on which the
leaders in control were opposed to the best opinion among the
people at large, was that of the franchise. The question was,
whether Massachusetts was to remain the private preserve of
a persecuting religious sect, or was to be the home of a free
people. For half a century, the leaders and the old church
party had resisted, by every means in their power,—by fraud,
trickery, and bloodshed, as well as by legitimate influence,—the
granting of a voice in the government to any individual who
could not be counted upon to uphold the power and authority
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>of the priesthood and the Church. Little by little, that
power and authority had been declining as, on the one hand,
the people had grown in intellectual independence, and, on
the other, the leaders had shown themselves less and less
worthy of their exalted position. But, in England, Mather
was exerting every means to fasten the shackles permanently
on the colony by insisting upon the old Congregational test
for the suffrage. In acting thus, he claimed to be the representative,
not of one element, but of the whole people, a majority
of whom would have been disfranchised by his success. What
the people themselves were thinking was shown by the vote at
the town-meeting of Watertown on May 20, 1689, to choose
representatives for the convention. After it had been agreed
that they should be instructed to vote for the resumption
of the charter, until further orders were received from England,
it was added, as the only but significant restriction,
that the number of freemen “be inlarged further then have
been the Custom of this Colony formerly.”<a id='r1100'></a><a href='#f1100' class='c014'><sup>[1100]</sup></a> In this crisis,
therefore, as has been the case all through our narrative, it is
necessary to distinguish clearly the two separate struggles for
freedom—that between the colony as a whole and England,
and that between the liberal element among the people and
the narrow oligarchical leaders, lay and clerical, of the theocratical
party in control.</p>

<p class='c001'>The weakness of the provisional government, due both to
the character of the men composing it, and to the lack of a
clear mandate from the people, was evident from the start.
When, for example, Dudley was released from prison on account
of illness, on a bond for £1000, and confined to his own house,
a mob broke into it and carried him back to jail. The keeper
refused to retain him without a warrant, and he was again
confined, in another house. The mob having discovered this,
the excitement became so great, and the control of the government
was so slight, that Bradstreet, the Governor, had to
write to Dudley, and abjectly beg him to reincarcerate himself
voluntarily, as otherwise the authorities could not protect his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>family.<a id='r1101'></a><a href='#f1101' class='c014'><sup>[1101]</sup></a> A fortnight later, a writer from Boston stated that
there was much division among the people, and that “every
man is a Governor.” Another wrote, July 31, 1689, that “all is
confusion”; and, in October, Elizabeth Usher sent word to her
husband that “there is little trade and the ferment is as great
as ever.” A few days later, Governor Bradstreet himself was
complaining to the Lords of Trade of the people who “are
busy to weaken the hands of the Government,” and lamenting
the Indian depredations and the empty treasury.<a id='r1102'></a><a href='#f1102' class='c014'><sup>[1102]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Almost the first act of the provisional government had been
to draw off and disperse many of the troops left by Andros to
guard the eastern province, while the discipline of all was
ruined by the dismissing of a number of officers on religious
and political grounds.<a id='r1103'></a><a href='#f1103' class='c014'><sup>[1103]</sup></a> The Indians realized the situation,
and, with the arms and ammunition previously supplied to
them by the Boston merchants, descended upon the unhappy
settlers. The fort at Pemaquid, the great importance of which
had always been denied by the colonists because it was urged
by Andros, was captured, owing to the carelessness of the small
garrison left there, and about twenty houses were destroyed
by the savages. At Saco, Oyster River, and other places,
houses were burned, and the inhabitants murdered, and all
the horrors of Indian warfare once more came thick upon the
border. The sudden disintegration of the Dominion, the inability
of the separate colonies to act together quickly and harmoniously,
and the lack of authority and military ability, left
the frontier defenseless. In April, 1689, war had been declared
between France and England, and the colonies seemed helpless
before the menace of the French and Indians from the north.</p>

<p class='c001'>A few weeks after Massachusetts had disbanded the forces
that Andros had collected, the government attempted to raise
more by a draft. The people questioned both its authority
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>to press men, and its ability to pay them, and, for the most
part, flatly refused either to volunteer or to be drafted.<a id='r1104'></a><a href='#f1104' class='c014'><sup>[1104]</sup></a> A
large part of Maine and the country eastward was overrun,
and in October the inhabitants were reported to be flocking
into Boston.<a id='r1105'></a><a href='#f1105' class='c014'><sup>[1105]</sup></a> In that month, Bradstreet wrote to the Lords
of Trade that there had been great depredations in Maine,
New Hampshire, and even in Massachusetts, and that the
government's efforts to check them had been of no avail,
although a joint force had finally been raised by Plymouth,
Connecticut, and Massachusetts.<a id='r1106'></a><a href='#f1106' class='c014'><sup>[1106]</sup></a> Part of this force, wretchedly
clothed and poorly supplied, had been sent eastward
under Colonel Church, the veteran of Philip's War, but had
accomplished little. Indeed, so carelessly was it outfitted
and officered, that it was only when unexpectedly forced into
action that the unhappy soldiers discovered that the ammunition
did not fit their guns.</p>

<p class='c001'>In January, 1690, the people of Maine sent a petition to
England, complaining of lack of protection by Massachusetts,
begging for help, and placing their losses at three hundred
lives and £40,000 in goods.<a id='r1107'></a><a href='#f1107' class='c014'><sup>[1107]</sup></a> The people of Great Island, New
Hampshire, likewise wrote to the mother-country, complaining
of Massachusetts and of the danger from the French and
Indians.<a id='r1108'></a><a href='#f1108' class='c014'><sup>[1108]</sup></a> In midwinter, came the frightful massacres at
Schenectady and Salmon Falls; and even Bradstreet and the
Council, on behalf of Massachusetts herself, wrote to the
Lords of Trade, begging for arms and ammunition. The
request was granted, and stores, including two hundred barrels
of powder, were ordered shipped to Boston by the English
government, although too late for the purpose that the colonists
had had in mind but had not stated.<a id='r1109'></a><a href='#f1109' class='c014'><sup>[1109]</sup></a> In addition, the English
navy was active in providing convoys for all the colonial
shipping, including that of New England.<a id='r1110'></a><a href='#f1110' class='c014'><sup>[1110]</sup></a> Such items in the
English records as “the convoys for Virginia, Maryland,
Newfoundland and New England will sail on the 31st. October,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>and that for Africa on the 20th.,” or a list of ninety merchant
ships, forming only one of the convoyed fleets from America,
or the request by Massachusetts for a royal ship-of-war to
guard her coastwise commerce, were the best answers to such
premature “patriots” as the Reverend Joshua Moody, who was
telling the men of Boston that they had no dependence on the
Crown, and that the power of England was of no authority
over them.<a id='r1111'></a><a href='#f1111' class='c014'><sup>[1111]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The plan which had been conceived, and for which additional
resources were needed, was that of attacking the French,
who were the driving force behind the Indian raids, at their
headquarters in Canada, instead of carrying on an almost
impossible system of defensive tactics along a frontier several
hundred miles long. The theory was good; but to put it in
practice would require leaders with military ability, and a
whole-hearted willingness on the part of the separate colonies
to sink their petty jealousies and act together. Unfortunately,
both the ability and the spirit of coöperation were lacking.</p>

<p class='c001'>Massachusetts, indeed, carried out an easy and successful
raid upon Acadia, whither Sir William Phips sailed from
Nantasket, on April 28, 1690, with five ships and several
hundred soldiers.<a id='r1112'></a><a href='#f1112' class='c014'><sup>[1112]</sup></a> Phips, who is said to have been one of
twenty-six children of a Maine backwoodsman, and who in
his youth was unable to read or write, had acquired wealth
and social position, first, by the not very original method of
marrying a rich widow, and, secondly, by the more unusual
one of locating a sunken treasure-ship with £300,000 sterling,
of which his share was a considerable one. He had already
married the widow. When he arrived at Port Royal, in command
of the Massachusetts fleet, he had no difficulty in securing
the surrender of the fort, as his force outnumbered the
garrison ten to one. A succinct diary tells, in admirable style,
the important events of his short sojourn, it being pertinent
to note that the Reverend Joshua Moody was his chaplain.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>“May, 11. The fort surrendered. May, 12. Went ashore to
search for hidden goods. We cut down the cross, rifled the
church, pulled down the high altar, and broke their images.
May, 13. Kept gathering plunder all day. May, 14. The
inhabitants swore allegiance to King William and Queen
Mary.”<a id='r1113'></a><a href='#f1113' class='c014'><sup>[1113]</sup></a> All very satisfying, doubtless, to the Reverend
Mr. Moody. But, unfortunately, the plunder, about the distribution
of which some unpleasant things were later said in
Boston, was found to amount to £3000 less than the cost of
the expedition.<a id='r1114'></a><a href='#f1114' class='c014'><sup>[1114]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The easy conquest, however, inspired larger hopes, while
the common danger to all the colonies might have been counted
upon to induce them to lay aside their particularism, and join
in a common effort, if anything could. A meeting of commissioners
from Massachusetts, Plymouth, Connecticut, and
New York was held at the latter city, and a combined attack
on Canada was planned.<a id='r1115'></a><a href='#f1115' class='c014'><sup>[1115]</sup></a> A land force, made up of troops
from Maryland and the four colonies just mentioned, was to
march from Albany to capture Montreal, while, simultaneously,
a fleet from Boston was to attack Quebec. There seems to
have been no realization of the difficulties of carrying out such
a complex joint operation, although, to the very letter notifying
the English government of the grandiose scheme, had to
be added a postscript, to the effect that there were already
“great distractions amongst the Forces.” Everything went
wrong. New York provided only one hundred and fifty of
the four hundred men promised. The hundred and sixty
sent from Massachusetts were recalled on news of the sacking
of Casco. Plymouth sent none, and Connecticut less than her
quota; the Indian allies, always uncertain, declined to move,
and there were desertions among the whites. The colonies
fell out over the appointment of a commander, agreement, but
not harmony, finally being attained with the selection of
Winthrop.<a id='r1116'></a><a href='#f1116' class='c014'><sup>[1116]</sup></a> Although the unfortunate force, ill-equipped and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>badly organized, reached Wood Creek, near the southern end
of Lake Champlain, they were unable to advance farther,
and, save for a little skirmishing, the whole expedition was a
costly failure, demonstrating conclusively that, even in the
face of overwhelming danger, the colonies, if left to themselves,
were as yet unable to unite in effective action.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although the naval expedition against Quebec reached its
objective, it also was unsuccessful, and was a mixture of farce
and tragedy. Phips, who was quite incompetent as the leader
of such an undertaking, was put in chief command, and on
August 9 sailed from Boston with a force of about twenty-two
hundred men, in thirty-two vessels of all sorts, mostly
small. For some reason, which does not appear, nine weeks
were consumed in reaching Quebec, of which the last three
were spent within a few days of the city, owing to the lack of
a pilot.<a id='r1117'></a><a href='#f1117' class='c014'><sup>[1117]</sup></a> The failure of the land expedition against Montreal,
and Phips's delay in ascending the river, had allowed Frontenac
to reach Quebec with reinforcements before the hostile fleet
dropped anchor a little below the town. The conqueror of
Port Royal first tried the effect of a demand for surrender, and
sent a summons “as severe as our four clergymen (who were
joined to the Council of War) could make it.”<a id='r1118'></a><a href='#f1118' class='c014'><sup>[1118]</sup></a> Frontenac
treated it with contempt, and refused to send more than a
verbal reply, except by his cannon.</p>

<p class='c001'>Phips then called another council of war, and delayed action
while seven hundred more reinforcements arrived at the city.
The plan finally decided upon was a simultaneous attack by
land and water. About twelve hundred men were to be landed,
and after crossing a small river, were to ascend to the rear of
the city, which they were to attempt to carry by assault,
while the fleet bombarded it from the front. The land forces,
under Major Walley, were set on shore, where they remained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>for some days, unable to advance, and suffering greatly from
disease, hunger, and exposure. The necessary and expected
support which the fleet was to provide them was almost wholly
lacking, and neither boats, ammunition, nor food was supplied
in proper quantities. On the other hand, Phips, with a total
disregard of the land expedition with which he was supposed
to be coöperating, fired away all the fleet's scanty store of
powder and shot, expending a considerable portion of it in
an unsuccessful effort to hit a picture of the Holy Family, which
had been hung on the cathedral spire. Nothing having been
accomplished by the futile cannonading, except to provide the
Quebec gunners with shot for their guns, and the English ammunition
being exhausted, the incompetent commander had
nothing to do but to order a retreat and return to Boston.
The land forces under Walley had behaved well, but in reëmbarking
lost all semblance of discipline, took to the boats
much like a base-ball crowd to the street cars, and abandoned
their cannon.<a id='r1119'></a><a href='#f1119' class='c014'><sup>[1119]</sup></a> The self-flattering belief of democracy that
training of any sort is a waste of time, and that, in military
affairs, competent commanders and disciplined troops can be
found at any moment in a crisis, had again proved a costly
fallacy.</p>

<p class='c001'>In November, Phips reached Boston with the first of his
armada; and other vessels continued to straggle in at intervals
until February. Some of them were never heard of at all. As
the colony gradually came to a realization of the magnitude
of the disaster, it was in despair, as it well might be. Few
men had fallen in fighting, but, owing to the incompetence and
thoughtlessness of the leaders, both civil and military, the
mortality had been great. The lack of clothes and food, the
cold, smallpox, fever, and exposure had killed men by scores.
The loss was estimated as high as a thousand, and certainly
ran into many hundreds.<a id='r1120'></a><a href='#f1120' class='c014'><sup>[1120]</sup></a> Moreover, the government, with
an empty treasury, had recklessly financed the expedition by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>promises to pay, expecting to be reimbursed from the anticipated
plunder. There was no plunder, and the colossal failure
had cost £50,000.<a id='r1121'></a><a href='#f1121' class='c014'><sup>[1121]</sup></a> A Boston merchant wrote to a correspondent
in London that, since assuming office, the new government
had involved the colony to the extent of, possibly, £200,000,
and that it was almost “run aground.”<a id='r1122'></a><a href='#f1122' class='c014'><sup>[1122]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Virtually bankrupt, and with the discharged soldiers and
other creditors clamoring for their pay, the government took
the first step on the road to paper money, which was later to
cost it dear. The debts were ordered paid with certificates
receivable for taxes, ranging in denomination from two shillings
to ten pounds.<a id='r1123'></a><a href='#f1123' class='c014'><sup>[1123]</sup></a> An original issue of £7000 was increased in
a few months to £40,000; and owing to the government's
lack of credit and stability, the notes fell quickly in value, and
were soon at a discount of thirty to fifty per cent.<a id='r1124'></a><a href='#f1124' class='c014'><sup>[1124]</sup></a> Taxes rose
to formerly unheard-of amounts, and the depression both of
business and of sentiment became extreme.<a id='r1125'></a><a href='#f1125' class='c014'><sup>[1125]</sup></a> Cotton Mather
was said to be satisfied to attribute all the colony's troubles
to the presence of the Episcopalian congregation worshiping
in the King's Chapel; and the Governor and Council wrote
to England, pointing out that the whole disaster must have
been due to God, who had “spit in our faces”—a phrase for
a state paper which darts a vivid light, in several directions,
among the colony's elect.<a id='r1126'></a><a href='#f1126' class='c014'><sup>[1126]</sup></a> There were many, however, who
were inclined to lay the blame for the growing ruin of all their
affairs in less exalted quarters. The government did its best
to suppress or refute all criticism, and the press, whose lack of
freedom had been so bitterly complained of only a few months
before under Andros, was quickly taken in hand again, and a
stricter censorship than ever established.<a id='r1127'></a><a href='#f1127' class='c014'><sup>[1127]</sup></a> Although nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>could be printed except propaganda in favor of the provisional
government, the increasing discontent of many in all classes
made itself heard, both in the colony and in England.</p>

<p class='c001'>Despite all that has been written of the town-meeting, and
the general impression that the average New Englander was
almost solely a political and religious animal, there is little
evidence to prove that the ordinary man in that section cared
any more about government than the ordinary man in Virginia
or Maryland. In fact, at a little later period, the more
accurate election returns would seem to indicate that he then
cared even less.<a id='r1128'></a><a href='#f1128' class='c014'><sup>[1128]</sup></a> The small minority that ran the government
and the churches was naturally active and vocal. But the
fact that four fifths of the people were reasonably content
to join no church, and to have no voice in the government,
certainly does not argue, in that time and place, any very
high degree of political, religious, or intellectual interest as
compared with the rest of America. In the blue haze of that
incense in honor of the colonial New Englanders, lighted by
themselves and tended by their descendants, we are apt, a
little absurdly sometimes, to lose sight of coarse fundamentals.
The average man or boy in the New England of this period
probably looked upon the theory that the main end of the
colony's existence was to make the world safe for the Congregational
church, in very much the same way in which those of
us who happened to be in France lately found that the average
“doughboy” regarded his main end there to be making the
world safe for democracy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such very truthful remarks as that already quoted, made
by the residents of Cape Ann, when they replied to an early
whiff of the incense by saying that their main end had been
fish, cannot be too much emphasized. They are as precious as
they are rare. Impersonal love of liberty is about as common
as uncombined oxygen; and so long as the average man could
catch cod, sell whiskey to the Indians, raise crops on land he
felt was his own, or stand at his little shop-counter, he did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>not much care—much as, by way of conversation, he might
talk—about the governor in Boston or the king in England.
But let him believe that either was threatening his God-given
right to accumulate pine-tree shillings, and there would be
trouble.</p>

<p class='c001'>This, the Governor and Council, by their evident inability
to handle the situation, were rapidly bringing about. There
is nothing unexpected in the cry now beginning to ascend to
England, that “we mightily want a government,”<a id='r1129'></a><a href='#f1129' class='c014'><sup>[1129]</sup></a> or unpatriotic
in the attitude of those who did not desire the complete
restoration of the former conditions. In England, however,
that was exactly what the agents, with Mather at their
head, were striving for. Their charges against Andros had
entirely broken down, as had their hopes of a restoration
of the old charter.<a id='r1130'></a><a href='#f1130' class='c014'><sup>[1130]</sup></a> Attempts to have it restored by Parliamentary
action or by a Writ of Error had both failed, and the
agents' efforts were thereafter directed to obtaining from the
King a new charter, with as favorable terms as possible.<a id='r1131'></a><a href='#f1131' class='c014'><sup>[1131]</sup></a> It
may be pointed out that the agents were not representatives
of the colony as a whole, but only of the old church party, and
that the terms which would be considered favorable by them
would be such as would ensure continued control by the theocratic
element.</p>

<p class='c001'>The echoes of the events in the colony that we have been
describing had been sounding in England with increasing
loudness and frequency, in the shape of private letters and
formal addresses.<a id='r1132'></a><a href='#f1132' class='c014'><sup>[1132]</sup></a> Mather, indeed, attempted to minimize
all complaints from the colony, from whatever source, and was
somewhat reckless in his imputations and disregard of facts.
Thirty-four petitioners of Charlestown, including many substantial
men, he characterized as “a few bankrupt Publicans
and Vagabonds,” “persons brought up and educated in all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>manner of Debauchery and Depravation,” “greedy as Hell.”<a id='r1133'></a><a href='#f1133' class='c014'><sup>[1133]</sup></a>
In his effort to prove the great prosperity and importance of
New England under the old theocratic government, he grotesquely
claimed that, whereas New England had turned a
wilderness into a fruitful field, most of the other colonies had
“turned a fruitful field into a barren wilderness.” The facts
were probably far better known to the Lords of Trade than
they were to Mather, and these showed that the population
of the other colonies outnumbered that of New England more
than two to one, while of England's colonial trade seven
eighths was with the “barren wildernesses” of the sugar and
tobacco colonies, and only one ninth with New England's
“fruitful field.”<a id='r1134'></a><a href='#f1134' class='c014'><sup>[1134]</sup></a> In that very year, of the two hundred and
twenty-six ships sailing from England to colonial ports, but
seven were bound for New England.<a id='r1135'></a><a href='#f1135' class='c014'><sup>[1135]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Mather's anonymous but scarcely veiled threats that the
colony would revolt, if the old theocracy and its charter privileges
were not restored,<a id='r1136'></a><a href='#f1136' class='c014'><sup>[1136]</sup></a> failed to impress the government,
which, however, had been seriously endeavoring to meet all
the legitimate aspirations of the colonists. Mather, who had
had several interviews with King William, and had enlisted
the sympathy of the Queen,<a id='r1137'></a><a href='#f1137' class='c014'><sup>[1137]</sup></a> had little difficulty in getting a
number of proposals altered, when the reasons were pointed
out; but the King and government were both firm in favor
of a governor appointed by England, and a property, not a
religious, qualification for the franchise. Mather bitterly
opposed both these suggestions, particularly that relating to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>the suffrage, saying he would sooner part with his life than
consent. The ministers of state, however, were growing somewhat
tired of the clergyman's representations and misrepresentations,
and curtly told him that his consent was neither
“expected nor desired”; that he was not a plenipotentiary
from a sovereign state; and that, if it was true, as he claimed,
that Massachusetts would not accept the new charter, then
she could “take what would follow,” for “his Majesty was
resolved to settle the Countrey.”<a id='r1138'></a><a href='#f1138' class='c014'><sup>[1138]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The obvious fact that the colonists were not by any means
unanimous in their desire for the old charter, the genuine wish
of the English government to provide toleration, the long
record of delays and bickerings in the colony's relations with
England, and the necessity for a different organization if the
Navigation Acts were to be enforced, probably all had their
influence in shaping the government's policy. Of still greater
immediate import, perhaps, was the military situation. With
the prospect of a life-and-death struggle with France, the
Franco-British frontier in America became a sphere of the
highest military interest and importance; and, aside from previous
records or any preconceived ideas on the part of English
statesmen, the colonists had, within the past year, shown that,
if left to themselves, they were unable properly to safeguard
either their own homes or the interests of the Empire.</p>

<p class='c001'>As a matter of fact, the new charter, as finally granted, was
a far better document than the one desired by Mather. What
he had tried to get was a constitution for a virtually independent
theocratic state, the fundamental law of which should
provide for the perpetual retention of political power in the
hands of a religious sect. What the English government
granted was a charter by which the colony took her natural
place, indeed, in an empire without whose protection she was
defenseless, but which, at the same time, gave to her citizens
a degree of self-government and political freedom which the
theocratic group would never have been willing to concede.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>The substitution of a moderate property qualification for the
franchise, in place of any other whatsoever, at once placed the
colony abreast of the most liberal political thought of the day;
while local self-government was restored in the form of a
popular assembly. Regardless of the whims or religious prejudices
of any clique in power, and irrespective of his class or
creed, any resident of the colony who had been sufficiently
industrious or fortunate to acquire a freehold estate worth forty
shillings per annum, or real or personal property to the value
of forty pounds, could now claim, as a right, a voice in the government
of his commonwealth.<a id='r1139'></a><a href='#f1139' class='c014'><sup>[1139]</sup></a> Thanks to England, the final
deathblow had legally been dealt to the theocracy, and the
foundation laid for genuine self-government and religious toleration
in the colony. Those elements in its future development
which we are apt to consider as typically American had, in
fact, in the case of Massachusetts, been forced upon her leaders,
fighting against them to the last ditch, by an English King who
could hardly speak the language of his subjects.</p>

<p class='c001'>One important aspect of this change in the franchise must
not be overlooked. Under the old religious test, there had
been, within the body of enfranchised voters, no social question.
All had possessed the vote, without distinction between
rich and poor. The struggle for the franchise, therefore,
would always have remained a purely religious one between
those within and those without the pale of a particular church.
With the abandonment of the religious test, and the substitution
of a property qualification, the question became a social
one, and the way was opened for that struggle for the democratization
of the state and society which became the dominant
motive in the Revolution of a century later. The colonies
could never have united on a question of religion, or even of
trade. The basis had to be so wide as to appeal to the most
numerous class in every colony; and that appeal could only
be social, and was found to lie in the demand for the abolition
of privilege and the extension of democracy.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>The new charter of 1691 must be regarded as an honest
effort to devise such a governmental system as should allow
to the colonists the greatest degree of local liberty consistent
with the welfare and administrative necessities of the Empire
as a whole, in the light of existing political theory. It cannot
too often be pointed out that the colonial period <em>was</em> a colonial
period, and that the relations subsisting between England and
the colonies were necessarily those subsisting between a sovereign
state and its dependencies. There was no more reason
for the colonist of Massachusetts or Barbadoes to consider
himself entirely independent of English control, than there is
for the settler in Alaska to consider himself wholly independent
of the United States to-day. It is inconsistent to claim that
the authority of Congress, in the twentieth century, should
reach to Guam or Nome, but that the authority of Parliament,
in the seventeenth, should have stopped at Land's End. To
find fault with administrative arrangements proper under the
above conditions, merely because they would have been unsuitable
had the subsequently revolting colonies then been the
independent states they later developed into, is to look through
the wrong end of the historian's telescope. If we are to judge
the governments provided for the colonies in comparison with
models in later American history, they should not be compared
with the constitutions of our sovereign states, but with those
provided for our own dependent colonies and territories; and
in their broader features, the constitutions granted by Congress
to organized territories reproduce very closely the old royal
governments of the earlier period.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the first place, we may note that the governor of a territory
is not elected by the people, but is appointed by the
president, and is removable by him, as the Massachusetts
charter of 1691 provided that her governor should be removable
by the king. In territories, as in the colonies, laws passed
by the bicameral legislature are subject, not only to veto by
the governor, but also to disallowance by the higher sovereign
power. The review of colonial legislation, to which our forefathers
objected so strongly when colonists, we adopted ourselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>when we, in turn became a “mother-country”; and in
some cases, at least, the laws passed by territorial legislatures
were specifically made subject to review by Congress. It is
needless to remind the reader that the citizens of our territories
are no more directly represented in that body than the colonists
were in Parliament, and that taxation without direct representation
is as much a factor in our present state as it was in
the British Empire. In one respect, the Massachusetts charter
of 1691, indeed, was more liberal than our territorial governments;
for in Massachusetts the judges were appointed by the
governor with the consent of the council, or upper house of
the legislature, while in American territories they are appointed
by the president without the consent of the inhabitants.<a id='r1140'></a><a href='#f1140' class='c014'><sup>[1140]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>To many in the colony, however, the change from the old
charter form to the new seemed a loss of independence. The
former governing element felt that their control had been
vastly weakened. The church party anticipated that the end
of all things might be due when the Congregational church no
longer legally controlled the elections. The presence of a governor
and other officials appointed by the Crown, the review
of legislation, the right of appeal, and other evidences of the
colony having become part of a great organization instead of
a practically independent, even if insignificant, little collection
of towns, was unwelcome to those who had had a false idea of
the rôle which, in that time and place, it was possible for them
and the colony to play in the world.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, there were very substantial advantages
under the new régime. Although, owing to an obscure and
probably not very reputable intrigue, New Hampshire was
given a separate government, the bounds of the new Massachusetts
were extended to include Plymouth, Maine, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>eastern country as far as Nova Scotia.<a id='r1141'></a><a href='#f1141' class='c014'><sup>[1141]</sup></a> Moreover, the colonists
had never really possessed anything like the rights
which they had claimed and exercised under the old charter.
The whole system of town government, for example, had been
extra-legal. The infliction of the death-penalty was illegal,
and there was no question that the colonists had exceeded
their rights in taxing the non-freemen. Now all the false
reasoning and sophistries that the settlers had indulged in,
in their efforts to prove the old charter adequate as the basis
of a government, were no longer necessary. Massachusetts
at last had, what she had never possessed before, a written
constitution, which clearly set forth her form of government,
and validated, to a very great extent, those institutions which
she had cherished.<a id='r1142'></a><a href='#f1142' class='c014'><sup>[1142]</sup></a> The royal officials, disliked as their presence
might be by the irreconcilables, actually and symbolically
brought the colony into relations with the larger life
of the empire. In her thought, her commerce, and her political
relations, New England's largest colony was at last forced out
of that position of defiant isolation which her former leaders
had chosen for her, and made to participate, so far as her
provincial position allowed, in the main currents of the world's
activities. The new charter definitely marked the end of
one era and the beginning of another.</p>

<p class='c001'>This change was more than political and economic. It has
been evident from the foregoing narrative that the power of
the clergy had been felt in every sphere of the colony's life.
In the pulpits, in the schools, in the colleges, in the censorship
of the press, in the legislature, even in the councils of war and
the courts of justice, their influence had been incalculable.
The story of the struggle against it, and of its gradual yielding
to defeat, as the people more and more made good their right
to believe as they would and live their lives as they chose,
has occupied many of our pages. The course of development,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>however, which was to make Massachusetts the leader of liberal
thought among the states, was a long one, and, in part, it was
but a reaction and a protest against the theological repression
of this earlier period.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although the charter of 1691 had definitely ended the legalized
control of the Congregational church, which was still to
maintain a privileged position until 1812, the organization
desperately struggled to retain its power. The members of
the new government, thanks to the efforts of Mather in England,
were nearly all of the clerical party. He had, indeed,
succeeded in having the more important offices filled with the
most fanatical, or the most subservient, of the men in the
colony's public life. His son, the Reverend Cotton Mather,
when he heard of the list of officials, wrote ecstatically in his
diary: “The time for Favour was now come; the sett Time
was come! ... all the Councellors of the Province are of my
own Father's Nomination; and my Father-in-law, with several
related unto me, and several Brethren of my own church, are
among them. The Governour of the Province is not my
Enemy but one whom I baptized, namely Sir William Phips,
and one of my own Flock, and one of my dearest Friends.”<a id='r1143'></a><a href='#f1143' class='c014'><sup>[1143]</sup></a>
He might have added that the savagely bigoted Stoughton
was made Deputy Governor.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the very time when this effort was being made still to
control the government, in spite of its altered form, events
occurred that gave a staggering blow to that unofficial power
which the clergy had been accustomed to exert as the acknowledged
intellectual leaders of the community. For, in
the generation of 1690, the witchcraft frenzy, in which the
clergy took a leading part, brought about the same sort of
anti-clerical reaction that had been a result of the Quaker persecutions
by them in the generation of 1660.</p>

<p class='c001'>We shall not concern ourselves with the details of the
horrible delusion, which, for the last time in New England,
caused the blood of innocent victims to be shed as a result of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>theological beliefs. They may be found amply set forth elsewhere,
and concern rather the antiquarian and the psychologist
than the historian.<a id='r1144'></a><a href='#f1144' class='c014'><sup>[1144]</sup></a> For us, the interest lies in their influence
upon the intellectual development of the colony, and the growth
of its people.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is quite true that communities in all ages and places have
been occasionally subject to being thrown off their mental
balance, and during the period of frenzy or panic have committed
acts of folly or crime, for which they have subsequently
been heartily repentant. But to state a fact is not to explain
it; and to find the underlying cause of the psychologic disturbance
in northeastern Massachusetts in 1692—during
which two hundred persons were accused of being in league
with the devil, one hundred and fifty were imprisoned, and
twenty-nine put to death,—in such influences as the loss of the
charter, or the “harsh aspects of the scenery,” seems to me
wholly inadequate, to say the least.<a id='r1145'></a><a href='#f1145' class='c014'><sup>[1145]</sup></a> The scenery of the native
American wild “invited to stern and melancholy musing,”
as New England's best-known historian phrases it, for about a
thousand miles north and south of Mr. Mather's study in
Boston, or the Reverend Mr. Parris's cottage in Salem Village,
and would seem to be rather dispersed as the cause of a very
localized phenomenon.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is needless to point out that the belief in witchcraft had
been widespread throughout the world; but since the days of
King James I, there had been, among English people, only
isolated cases, save during the years of the Puritan political
supremacy in England and the closing days of that same
supremacy in Massachusetts.<a id='r1146'></a><a href='#f1146' class='c014'><sup>[1146]</sup></a> Of the more than seventy cases
in England since the Restoration, the great majority had resulted
in acquittals, and in two cases only had the unfortunate
victims been executed.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>We have seen, in an earlier chapter, the extraordinarily large
sphere accorded to the devil in Puritan theology, and that
theology's virtual repudiation of science by its considering
every event in the universe, from the sun's course in heaven
to a spider's falling into the porridge, as a direct interposition
of the divine will. While Boyle, Newton, and other founders
of the new scientific age in England, were tracing the reign of
law, the intellectual leaders of New England were engaged in
gathering together collections of “remarkable providences,”
ranging in interest from the sudden death of a Sabbath-breaker
to the evident marking for destruction, out of a whole library,
of a copy of the book of Common Prayer, by a mouse evidently
brought up in the “New England way.” Of the moral earnestness
of such men there is no question, nor of the abiding stamp
which they have left upon the New England consciousness.
Happily, much of the good they did has survived, while much
of the political and intellectual damage they likewise did, and
would have continued to do, had they had their way, has
passed.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1681, a group of the most eminent of the clergy around
Boston determined upon a large coöperative work, to involve
the research of many authors, and the labor of some years.
It was to be a collection of remarkable providences, of divine
judgments, of “thunders as are unusual, strange apparitions,
or whatever else shall happen that is prodigious, witchcrafts,
diabolical possessions, judgments upon noted sinners,” and
the like.<a id='r1147'></a><a href='#f1147' class='c014'><sup>[1147]</sup></a> Each clergyman was to make diligent search among
his congregation, and it is obvious what a stimulant such a
wholesale inquiry among the people, by the intellectual leaders
of the community, would be toward arousing interest, and intensifying
the belief, in such matters. A few years later,
Increase Mather published his book on the subject, in which he
gave numerous cases of witchcraft and possession, and recited
the signs by which it might be known. It became the study
of the young Cotton Mather, whom in 1686, at the age of
twenty-three, we find wrestling in prayer to cast the devils out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>of New England, and undertaking to track down those leagued
with them.<a id='r1148'></a><a href='#f1148' class='c014'><sup>[1148]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Interest in the subject continued to be stirred up, and in
1688, the criminal nonsense of some children of Boston, and
their accusations against a washerwoman, resulted in her being
denounced as a witch. Cotton Mather, who had now found
the case for which he had been longing, and in which he might
do ghostly battle, took the eldest girl home with him. She
played upon the clergyman's colossal vanity, and, on evidence
which ought not to have shut up a dog, the unfortunate washerwoman
was hanged. Mather now proceeded, by another
book and by frenzied sermons, to arouse the fears and superstitions
of the crowd. With one of the most noted clergymen
in Boston doing all he could to foster it, the belief deepened
and spread, and the minds of many, who would not otherwise
have given thought to it, were prepared to believe in that
“plot of the Devil against New England” which Mather
preached.</p>

<p class='c001'>Early in 1692, some children of Salem feigned the symptoms
of which they had heard their elders speak. Two of
them belonged to the family of the local clergyman, Mr. Parris,
who now entered on the devil-hunt, with a fanaticism which
knew no bounds, and an honesty which seems to have been
questionable.<a id='r1149'></a><a href='#f1149' class='c014'><sup>[1149]</sup></a> To his efforts were added those of the Reverend
Mr. Noyes. Charge after charge was launched against
innocent people, and by the time Phips arrived in the colony
as governor, in May, over a hundred persons were already in
prison awaiting trial. Vain of his undeserved authority, the
appointee and pliant tool of Mather, he immediately appointed
an illegal court to try the witchcraft cases, with Stoughton as
presiding judge. In the frenzy of superstitious <a id='corr454.31'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='fanticism'>fanaticism</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_454.31'><ins class='correction' title='fanticism'>fanaticism</ins></a></span> which
followed, justice, legal evidence, even a verdict of the jury,
were set aside, and victim after victim hurried to the gallows,
while one, with horrible tortures lasting several days, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>pressed to death under heavy weights.<a id='r1150'></a><a href='#f1150' class='c014'><sup>[1150]</sup></a> The clergy, formally
referred to by the Governor and court for advice, while carefully
hedging as to certain particulars, urged the court on
to “speedy and vigorous prosecution”; and Mather wrote to
one of them, extolling “the noble service” of “Encountering
the Wicked Spiritts in the high places of our Air, &#38; of detecting
&#38; of confounding of their confederates.”<a id='r1151'></a><a href='#f1151' class='c014'><sup>[1151]</sup></a> The Reverend
Mr. Burroughs, of Wells, who avowed that “there neither
are, nor ever were witches,” was condemned; and although
the spectators at his hanging were so moved as almost to
prevent the sentence from being carried out, Mather, who was
witnessing the spectacle from horseback, told the people that
the victim was not an ordained clergyman, and that, in any
case, the devil often appeared as an Angel of Light.<a id='r1152'></a><a href='#f1152' class='c014'><sup>[1152]</sup></a></p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Finally, the reaction set in, and the sober sense of the community
set itself against the ravings and goadings of the more
fanatical clergy and church members. The commission of the
special court expired with the assembling of the General Court,
and was not renewed. Phips, evidently fearing criticism from
England, wrote to the Earl of Nottingham, disingenuously
laying all the blame for the judicial proceedings on Stoughton,
and quoted Increase Mather and the other divines.<a id='r1153'></a><a href='#f1153' class='c014'><sup>[1153]</sup></a> Courageous
laymen, like Thomas Brattle and Robert Calef, both merchants,
exerted their influence against the delusion; and when
Mather tried to start another alarm in Boston, less than a year
after the last execution at Salem, public opinion was arrayed
solidly against him. In 1700, Calef's book in answer to Mather's
“Wonders of the Invisible World” was printed in London
and quickly imported into the colony. Though the rage of
the Mathers, father and son, was unbounded, their cause had
been thoroughly discredited, and their day was past. They
belonged, in reality, to the sixteenth century, while Calef,
the merchant, defending the cause of intellectual freedom with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>no weapon but that of common sense, belonged to the eighteenth,
the dawn of which was now at hand.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was the voice of that century to which the people were
now to hearken. Thenceforth, happily for itself as well as for
America, the church was to be unable to rely either upon
political power or upon blind fanaticism to uphold its leadership—a
leadership which now, perforce, took on a nobler
form. The work of the founders was over. In the extension
of their influence throughout the country, wherever we find
groups of settlers from the New England states, we find, indeed
the church, the common-school, and the town-meeting; but it
is a liberalized church, a non-sectarian school, and a town-meeting
in which the citizen's vote is not dependent upon the
possession of any peculiar theological belief.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was usual, in an earlier and less critical day, to trace all
of New England's greatness, and of her noble contributions to
our common American life, to the same little group of leaders,
who were supposed to have done all because they did much.
Life is not so simple as that, and in the founding of New England,
and the development of her liberties, we must find place
for English kings and statesmen, for colonial liberals and martyrs,
as well as for Pilgrim Father and Puritan Priest.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the Index, an entry may <i>end</i>, after one or more subtopics, with
a list of general references, contrary to the more common practice,
where those general references precede any subtopics. On one occasion,
(<a href='#KEAYNES'>Keaynes</a> and the “sow case”), the semi-colon seems to be an error,
since the page sequence is retained, and all refer to that topic.</p>

<p class='c001'>Spelling in quoted material is frequently not modern, and only noted
(but not corrected) when suspicious.</p>

<p class='c001'>John Clarke of Rhode Island is mentioned on p. 258 and in footnote 656 is
'John Clark'. To avoid confusion, each instance has been corrected.</p>

<p class='c001'>Several words appear midline both hypenated and unhyphenated (breakdown/break-down,
foreshadow, fore-shadow, bloodthirsty/blood-thirsty) and both are retained. Where a
is hyphenated only on a line break, the hyphen is removed if there is another
instance midline without it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Errors deemed most likely to be the printer’s have been corrected, and
are noted here. The lion's share of those are small inconsistencies of
punctuation in the footnotes. The references are to the page and line
in the original.</p>
